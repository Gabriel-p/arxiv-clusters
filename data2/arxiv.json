    "summary": "  Massive neutrinos imprint distinctive signatures on the evolution of cosmic\nstructures, notably suppressing small-scale clustering. We investigate the\nimpact of massive neutrinos on the galaxy bispectrum in redshift-space,\nadopting a spherical harmonic multipole decomposition $B_L^m(k_1, \\mu, t)$,\nthat captures the full angular dependence. We develop an analytical and\nnumerical framework incorporating neutrino-corrected perturbation theory\nkernels and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that the linear\ntriangle configurations are particularly sensitive to massive neutrinos, with\ndeviations reaching up to $\\sim 2\\%$ for a total mass $\\sum m_\\nu =\n0.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. To assess detection prospects in galaxy surveys like\n\\textit{Euclid}, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual\nmultipoles, including the effects of Finger-of-God damping and shot noise. The\nneutrino-induced signatures in $B_0^0$ and $B_2^0$ are found to be detectable\nwith SNR $\\gtrsim 5$ across a range of configurations, even after accounting\nfor small-scale suppression. Higher-order multipoles such as $B_2^1$ and\n$B_2^2$ are moderately sensitive, with SNR $\\gtrsim$ ($2-3$) in squeezed\nlimits, while hexadecapole moments are more suppressed but still exhibit\nmeasurable signals at high $k_1$. Additionally, the SNR generally increases\nwith wave number $k_1$, particularly for squeezed and stretched triangles,\nsuggesting that access to smaller scales significantly enhances detection\nprospects.Our study highlights the potential of the redshift-space bispectrum\nmultipoles as sensitive probes of massive neutrinos, complementing traditional\npower spectrum analyses, and underscores the importance of angular information\nand higher-order statistics for galaxy surveys.\n",

    "summary": "  The convectively driven, weakly magnetized regions of the solar photosphere\ndominate the Sun's surface at any given time, but the temporal variations of\nthese quiet regions of the photosphere throughout the solar cycle are still not\nwell known. To look for cycle-dependent changes in the convective properties of\nquiet Sun photosphere, we use high spatial and spectral resolution\nspectropolarimetric observations obtained by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT) and apply the Spectropolarimetric Inversions Based on Response Functions\n(SIR) code to infer physical conditions in the lower solar photosphere. Using a\nhomogeneous set of 49 datasets, all taken at disk center, we analyze the\ntemperature stratification and the line-of-sight velocities of the granules and\nintergranules over a period of 15 years. We use a k-means clustering technique\napplied to the spectral profiles to segment the granules and intergranules\nbased on both intensity and velocity. We also examine the profile bisectors of\nthese different structures and compare these to past analyses. Our results show\nfairly constant properties over this period with no clear dependence on the\nsolar cycle. We do, however, find a slight increase in the photospheric\ntemperature gradient during the declining phase of the solar cycle. Our\nfindings could have significant implications for understanding the coupling\nbetween the quiet Sun atmosphere and the global solar dynamo.\n",

    "title": "The JWST weather report from the nearest brown dwarfs II: Consistent\n  variability mechanisms over 7 months revealed by 1-14 $μ$m NIRSpec + MIRI\n  monitoring of WISE 1049AB",
    "summary": "  We present a new epoch of JWST spectroscopic variability monitoring of the\nbenchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs\nknown. Our 8-hour MIRI low resolution spectroscopy (LRS) and 7-hour NIRSpec\nprism observations extended variability measurements for any brown dwarfs\nbeyond 11 $\\mu$m for the first time, reaching up to 14 $\\mu$m. Combined with\nthe previous epoch in 2023, they set the longest JWST weather monitoring\nbaseline to date. We found that both WISE 1049AB show wavelength-dependent\nlight curve behaviours. Using a robust k-means clustering algorithm, we\nidentified several clusters of variability behaviours associated with three\ndistinct pressure levels. By comparing to a general circulation model (GCM), we\nidentified the possible mechanisms that drive the variability at these pressure\nlevels: Patchy clouds rotating in and out of view likely shaped the dramatic\nlight curves in the deepest layers between 1-2.5 $\\mu$m, whereas hot spots\narising from temperature / chemical variations of molecular species likely\ndominate the high-altitude levels between 2.5-3.6 $\\mu$m and 4.3-8.5 $\\mu$m.\nSmall-grain silicates potentially contributed to the variability of WISE 1049A\nat 8.5-11 $\\mu$m. While distinct atmospheric layers are governed by different\nmechanisms, we confirmed for the first time that each variability mechanism\nremains consistent within its layer over the long term. Future multi-period\nobservations will further test the stability of variability mechanisms on this\nbinary, and expanded JWST variability surveys across the L-T-Y sequence will\nallow us to trace and understand variability mechanisms across a wider\npopulation of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects.\n",

    "summary": "  Significant numbers of free-floating planetary-mass objects have been\ndiscovered in nearby star-forming regions by the James Webb Space Telescope,\nincluding a substantial number (42) of Jupiter Mass Binary Objects ('JuMBOs')\nin the Orion Nebula Cluster. The JuMBOs have much wider separations than other\npopulations of substellar binaries, and their existence challenges conventional\ntheories of substellar and planetary-mass object formation. Whilst several\ntheories have been proposed to explain their formation, there has yet to be a\nstudy that determines whether they could survive the dynamical encounters\nprevalent within a dense star-forming region. We place a population of\nplanet-planet binaries in N-body simulations of dense star-forming regions and\ncalculate their binary fraction over time. We find that between 50-90 per cent\nof planet-planet binaries are destroyed on timescales of a few Myr, which\nimplies that many more must form if we are to observe them in their current\nnumbers. Furthermore, if the ONC was much more dense at formation, the initial\nseparation distribution of the JuMBOs must have been even wider (and less\nsimilar to other substellar binaries) than the observed distribution.\n",

    "title": "The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass\n  models",
    "summary": "  The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for\nunbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time\ndelays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass\nmodel to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations,\npositional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take\naccount of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the\ninterpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife\nmethod as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically\nfocusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple\nimages of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple\nimages of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the\nremoved source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed\npositions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in\nsimulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass\nmodeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of\nusing the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical\nquantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\n",

    "title": "Unified QMF equation of state for neutron star matter: Static and\n  dynamic properties",
    "summary": "  We construct a set of unified equations of state based on the quark mean\nfield (QMF) model, calibrated to different values of nuclear symmetry energy\nslope at the saturation density ($L_0$), with the aim of exploring both the\nstatic properties and dynamical behavior of neutron stars (NSs), and building a\ncoherent picture of their internal structure. We assess the performance of\nthese QMF models in describing the mass-radius relation, the cooling evolution\nof isolated NSs and X-ray transients, and the instabilities (e.g., the r-mode).\nIn comparison to relativistic mean field (RMF) models formulated at the\nhadronic level, the QMF model predicts heavier nuclear clusters and larger\nWigner-Seitz cell sizes in the NS crust, while the density of the free neutron\ngas remains largely similar between the two approaches. For the cooling of\nisolated NSs, the thermal evolution is found to be insensitive to both the\nmany-body model and the symmetry energy slope in the absence of the direct Urca\n(dUrca) process. However, when rapid cooling via the dUrca process is allowed,\nin the case of large $L_0$ values (e.g., $L_0 \\gtrsim 80$ MeV) in our study,\nthe QMF model predicts a longer thermal relaxation time. Both the QMF and RMF\nmodels can reproduce cooling curves consistent with observations of X-ray\ntransients (e.g., KS 1731--260) during their crustal cooling phase, although\nstellar parameters show slight variations depending on the model and symmetry\nenergy slope. Within our unified framework, a larger $L_0$ value generally\nresults in a wider instability window, while increasing the stellar mass tends\nto suppress the instability window. We also provide simple power-law\nparameterizations that quantify the dependence of bulk and shear viscosities on\nthe symmetry energy slope for nuclear matter at saturation density.\n",

    "title": "Compact stellar systems hosting an intermediate mass black hole:\n  magnetohydrodynamic study of inflow-outflow dynamics",
    "summary": "  Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole\ndemographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar\nclusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts,\nwhere accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.\nYet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We\ninvestigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and\nmetallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole\naccretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and\nmagnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical\nabundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to\nexplore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the\naccretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude\nrelative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows\ndriven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas.\nWhile enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense\nclumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The\nsystem's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds,\nmasking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived,\nquasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these\nflares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our\nresults naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters\nand provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared\nobservational strategies.\n",
