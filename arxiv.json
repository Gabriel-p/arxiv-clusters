    "summary": "  Stellar populations serve as a fossil record of galaxy formation and\nevolution, providing crucial information about the history of star formation\nand galaxy evolution. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) stands out as the most\naccurate tool currently available for inferring the star formation histories\n(SFHs) of nearby galaxies with stellar-resolved multiband data. The launch of\nnew space telescopes, including JWST, EUCLID, and the upcoming CSST and Roman,\nwill significantly increase the number of stellar-resolved galaxies over the\nnext decade. A user-friendly and customizable CMD fitting package would be\nvaluable for galaxy evolution studies with these data. We develop an\nopen-source Python-based package named \\textsc{pancake}, which is fast and\naccurate in determining SFHs and stellar population parameters in nearby\ngalaxies. We have validated our method via a series of comprehensive tests.\nFirst, \\textsc{pancake} performs well on mock data, meanwhile the random and\nsystematic uncertainties are quantified. Second, \\textsc{pancake} performs well\non observational data containing a star cluster and 38 dwarf galaxies (50\nfields). Third, the star formation rate (SFR) from \\textsc{pancake} is\nconsistent with the SFR from FUV photometry. To ensure compatibility and\naccuracy, we have included isochrone libraries generated using PARSEC for most\nof the optical and near-infrared filters used in space telescopes such as HST,\nJWST, and the upcoming CSST.\n",
