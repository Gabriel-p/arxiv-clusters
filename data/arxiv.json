    "title": "Luminosity Function of collapsar Gamma-Ray Bursts:the Progenitor of Long\n  Gamma-Ray Bursts Is Not Singular",
    "summary": "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful probes of the high-redshift universe.\nHowever, the proportion of collapsar GRBs among long GRBs and their event rate\nrelative to the star formation rate (SFR) remain contentious issues. We assume\nthat long GRBs with $z\\geq 2$ are all collapsar GRBs and construct the\nluminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite\nspanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law\nform and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and\ndensity evolution. Our results are as follows: 1) The no-evolution model can be\nruled out. 2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the\nobservations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution\nindex $\\delta = 1.54^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$) or density ($\\delta =\n2.09^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$) is required. This excludes the possibility that the\nevolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from non-collapsar\nGRBs. 3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar\nGRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq 1 \\, \\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\nis 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq\n1 \\, \\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$. The density evolution model\npredicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq 1 \\,\n\\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of\nthe observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long\nGRBs are not collapsar GRBs.\n",

Our NIRSpec data confirms that Phaethon's surface is\ndehydrated, showing no evidence of hydrated minerals in the 3-$\\mu$m region. We\nestimate an upper limit on the hydrogen content in phyllosilicates of 0.06 wt%.\nComparisons with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites suggest that\nPhaethon's surface composition is best matched by thermally metamorphosed\nsamples of the CM chondrite Murchison (heated to 1000$^{\\circ}$C), rather than\nCY meteorites as previous work suggested. We find no evidence of ongoing\nsurface evolution due to recent perihelion passages. A comparison of the\nmid-infrared spectra of Phaethon and Bennu shows distinct spectral differences\nthat are consistent with their different thermal histories. Our findings\nfurther refine our understanding of Phaethon's current surface composition and\nevolution and provide additional insights for the upcoming DESTINY+ mission.\n",

    "title": "Spectral-timing analysis of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations\n  and constraints on the mass of the neutron star in $4U 1636-536$ using\n  AstroSat observations",
    "summary": "  Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are believed to originate\nfrom the orbital timescales of the inner accretion flow, reflecting the\ndynamics of the innermost disk regions under strong gravitational forces.\nDespite numerous radiative and geometric models proposed so far, a\ncomprehensive explanation of the observed properties of these variability\ncomponents remains elusive. This study systematically examines kHz QPOs, their\nvariability, and their connection to spectral properties in $4U 1636-536$ using\nAstroSat data. Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft\nstates in the hardness-intensity diagram. Broad spectral analysis (0.7-25 keV)\nusing SXT and LAXPC data indicates a spectrum shaped by reflection from a\nthermal corona, with contributions from boundary layer emission and a soft disk\ncomponent. We find significant changes in optical depth, blackbody temperature,\nand inner disk temperature that likely drive state transitions. Power density\nspectra reveal three variability types: a low frequency QPO (LFQPOs) (~30 Hz),\nand two simultaneous kHz QPOs. The LFQPOs and the upper kHz QPOs appear more\nprominently in soft spectral states. The presence of LFQPOs and twin kHz QPOs\nin soft spectral states enable us to estimate the neutron star mass at (2.37\n$\\pm$ 0.02) $M_\\odot$ using the relativistic precession model (RPM).\nAdditionally, time-lag and root mean square (rms) analysis provide insights\ninto the size of the corona and the radiative origin of these variability\ncomponents.\n",

We describe the physical role of curvature in\ncosmological distance measures tied to recombination, i.e. the CMB and BAO, and\nthe relation to neutrino mass constraints which are relaxed to $\\sum m_\\nu <\n0.10$ eV when curvature is allowed to deviate from zero.

    "summary": "  Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise\ntransients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal\nparameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing\nstep, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g.\nBayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to\nbuild a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known\nglitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on\nthe glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference\nanalysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch\nidentification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches.

    "summary": "  Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich\ninformation from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys,\nand ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In\nthis work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD)\ndetection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based\nsimulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric\nfor OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques,\ndemonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous\ntime flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that\ncombine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with\nnormalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as\nquantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples\nbut also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we\nverified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while\nmitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our\nproof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings,\nour framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown\nsystematics in the cosmology datasets.\n",

    "title": "Turning dispersion into signal: density-split analyses of pairwise\n  velocities",
    "summary": "  Pairwise velocities of the large-scale structure encode valuable information\nabout the growth of structure. They can be observed indirectly through\nredshift-space distortions and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Whether it\nis Gaussian or non-Gaussian, pairwise velocity has a broad distribution, but\nthe cosmologically useful information lies primarily in the mean - the\nstreaming velocities; the dispersion around the mean is often treated as a\nnuisance and marginalized over. This conventional approach reduces the\nconstraining power of our observations. Here, we show that this does not have\nto be the case, provided the physics behind the dispersion is understood. We\ndemonstrate that by splitting the halo/galaxy samples according to their\ndensity environments and measuring the streaming velocities separately, the\ntotal signal-to-noise is several times greater than in conventional global\nmeasurements of the pairwise velocity distribution (PVD). This improvement\narises because the global PVD is a composite of a series of near-Gaussian\ndistributions with different means and dispersions, each determined by its\nlocal density environment. Around underdense and overdense regions, the mean\nstreaming velocities are positive and negative, respectively. By splitting the\ndata, we avoid cancellation between these opposing velocities, effectively\nturning what would be considered dispersion in the global PVD into a signal.\nOur findings indicate substantial potential for improving the analysis of PVD\nobservations using the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and redshift-space\ndistortions.\n",

    "summary": "  The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for\nunbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time\ndelays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass\nmodel to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations,\npositional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take\naccount of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the\ninterpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife\nmethod as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically\nfocusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple\nimages of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple\nimages of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the\nremoved source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed\npositions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in\nsimulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass\nmodeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of\nusing the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical\nquantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\n",

    "summary": "  We construct a set of unified equations of state based on the quark mean\nfield (QMF) model, calibrated to different values of nuclear symmetry energy\nslope at the saturation density ($L_0$), with the aim of exploring both the\nstatic properties and dynamical behavior of neutron stars (NSs), and building a\ncoherent picture of their internal structure. We assess the performance of\nthese QMF models in describing the mass-radius relation, the cooling evolution\nof isolated NSs and X-ray transients, and the instabilities (e.g., the r-mode).\nIn comparison to relativistic mean field (RMF) models formulated at the\nhadronic level, the QMF model predicts heavier nuclear clusters and larger\nWigner-Seitz cell sizes in the NS crust, while the density of the free neutron\ngas remains largely similar between the two approaches. For the cooling of\nisolated NSs, the thermal evolution is found to be insensitive to both the\nmany-body model and the symmetry energy slope in the absence of the direct Urca\n(dUrca) process. However, when rapid cooling via the dUrca process is allowed,\nin the case of large $L_0$ values (e.g., $L_0 \\gtrsim 80$ MeV) in our study,\nthe QMF model predicts a longer thermal relaxation time. Both the QMF and RMF\nmodels can reproduce cooling curves consistent with observations of X-ray\ntransients (e.g., KS 1731--260) during their crustal cooling phase, although\nstellar parameters show slight variations depending on the model and symmetry\nenergy slope. Within our unified framework, a larger $L_0$ value generally\nresults in a wider instability window, while increasing the stellar mass tends\nto suppress the instability window. We also provide simple power-law\nparameterizations that quantify the dependence of bulk and shear viscosities on\nthe symmetry energy slope for nuclear matter at saturation density.\n",

    "summary": "  We investigate the impact of spacetime non-commutativity on the tidal\ndeformability of compact objects and explore the feasibility of detecting\nnon-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We\nconsidered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge\ntheory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While\nseveral types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing\nspacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study\nshowed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their\nsurface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their\ntidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness\nlimit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute\nthe NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several\ndifferent models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing\nthe results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness\nregimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be\namplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction\ndominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the\nblack-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars\nare not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while\nrelying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.\n",

    "title": "Modeling Metric Gyrosynchrotron Radio Emission From the Quiet Solar\n  Corona",
    "summary": "  The radio emission of the quiet Sun in the metric and decametric bands has\nnot been well studied historically due to limitations of existing instruments.\nIt is nominally dominated by thermal brehmsstrahlung of the solar corona, but\nmay also include significant gyrosynchrotron emission, usually assumed to be\nweak under quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the expected\ngyrosynchrotron contribution to solar radio emission in the lowest radio\nfrequencies observable by ground instruments, for different regions of the low\nand middle corona. We approximate the coronal conditions by a synoptic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The thermal emission is estimated from a\nforward model based on the simulated corona. We calculate the expected\ngyrosynchrotron emission with the Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes framework by\nFleishman & Kuznetsov (2010). The model emissions of different coronal regions\nare compared with quiet-time observations between 20-90 MHz by the LOw\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope. The contribution of gyrosynchrotron\nradiation to low frequency solar radio emission may shed light on effects such\nas the hitherto unexplained brightness variation observed in decametric coronal\nhole emission, and help constrain measurements of the coronal magnetic fields.\nIt can also improve our understanding of electron populations in the middle\ncorona and their relation to the formation of the solar wind.\n",

    "title": "Thermal evolution model from cometary nuclei to asteroids considering\n  contraction associated with ice sublimation",
    "summary": "  Comet--asteroid transition (CAT) objects are small solar system bodies in the\nprocess of evolving from cometary nuclei into asteroids, as they gradually lose\nvolatile substances due to solar heating. The volatile material is mainly water\nice, and the time required for its complete depletion is called the desiccation\ntime. Estimating the desiccation time is important for examining the formation\nand evolution of small solar system bodies. Here, we propose a new theoretical\nmodel for evaluating the desiccation time as a function of orbital elements,\nconsidering the contraction of the entire cometary nucleus due to ice\nsublimation. First, we performed numerical calculations of the thermal\nevolution of a cometary nucleus in an eccentric orbit, considering the seasonal\nvariation in the solar heating rate. Next, we derived the desiccation time\nanalytically as a function of orbital elements based on a steady-state model\nconsidering the solar heating rate averaged over the seasons. We compared the\nnumerical solutions for the desiccation time with the analytical solutions and\nclarified the conditions under which the analytical model can be applied.\nAdditionally, based on the analytical model, we derived formulae for estimating\nthe emission rates of water vapor and dust on the surface of the cometary\nnucleus, the maximum size of the emitted dust, and the dust emission velocity,\nby assuming the amount of ice remaining inside the nucleus. Using these\nanalytical solutions, we considered the internal structure and evolution\nprocess of typical CAT objects. Our analytical model was generally consistent\nwith that of the results of earlier observations of these objects. Our model\nprovides a theoretical guideline for discussing the evolution of cometary\nnuclei and the possibility of retaining internal ice in asteroids.\n",

    "summary": "  We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia\nDR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the\nnumber identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria,\nASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15\nto 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming\nregion, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes\nat approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas\nmapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which\nmay have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with\nearlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the\nlarger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely\ninfluenced the interstellar medium (ISM).

    "title": "Constraints on the state of the IGM at $z\\sim 8-10$ using redshifted\n  21-cm observations with LOFAR",
    "summary": "  The power spectra of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of\nReionization (EoR) contain information about the ionization and thermal states\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM), and depend on the properties of the EoR\nsources. Recently, Mertens et al 2025 has analysed 10 nights of LOFAR high-band\ndata and estimated upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts 8.3,\n9.1 and 10.1. Here we use these upper limit results to constrain the properties\nof the IGM at those redshifts. We focus on the properties of the ionized and\nheated regions where the temperature is larger than that of the CMB. We model\nthe 21-cm power spectrum with the code GRIZZLY, and use a Bayesian inference\nframework to explore the source parameters for uniform priors on their ranges.\nThe framework also provides information about the IGM properties in the form of\nderived parameters. In a model which includes a radio background in excess of\nthe CMB, the 95 (68) per cent credible intervals of disfavoured models at\nredshift 9.1 for the chosen priors correspond to IGM states with averaged\nionization and heated fraction below 0.46 ($\\lesssim 0.05$), an average gas\ntemperature below 44 K (4 K), and a characteristic size of the heated region\n$\\lesssim 14 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$ ($\\lesssim 3 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$). The\n68 per cent credible interval suggests an excess radio background which is more\nthan 100 per cent of the CMB at 1.42 GHz, while the 95 per cent credible\ninterval of the radio background efficiency parameter spans the entire prior\nrange. The behaviour of the credible intervals is similar at all redshifts. The\nmodels disfavoured by the LOFAR upper limits are extreme ones, as they are\nmainly driven by rare and large ionized or heated regions.\n",

    "title": "Dust density enhancements and the direct formation of planetary cores in\n  gravitationally unstable discs",
    "summary": "  Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can\naccumulate to form planetary cores. There are a number of barriers to the\ncollisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift,\nor metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to\ncause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs,\npotentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from\nthe disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that\nexplore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is\nmassive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density\nwaves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and\nfind that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an\norder of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid\nparticles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to\nsufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo\ndirect gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically\nbetween $1$ and $10$ M$_\\oplus$. Thus, the concentration of dust in a\nself-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and\ndirectly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.\n",

    "title": "Attitude Control of Spacecraft for Autonomous Attenuation of Unknown\n  Periodic Disturbance Torque",
    "summary": "  Recently, deep space exploration, especially focusing on halo orbits, the\nperiodic orbits of the Moon, has been widely studied. The spacecraft in halo\norbits performs periodic orbital motion, which affects the attitude motion by\nperiodic disturbances. The conventional attitude control method, PD control, is\nwidely used, but its application to periodic disturbance attenuation is\ninefficient. To address these challenges, this study proposes a predictive\nRepetitive Control (RC) approach that addresses periodic disturbances,\nparticularly GG torque, by exploiting the periodic nature of the system\ndynamics. The proposed method is also applied to the case of using a Reaction\nWheel (RW) as an attitude control actuator. Despite the inherent challenges\nposed by RW limitations, including saturation torque and transmission delay,\nour predictive RC approach effectively mitigates these effects. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method in\nmaintaining attitude control for spacecraft traversing halo orbits near the\nEarth-Moon $L_2$ point, validating its potential for future deep space\nexploration missions.\n",

    "title": "Denoising weak lensing mass maps with diffusion model: systematic\n  comparison with generative adversarial network",
    "summary": "  (abridged) Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is the unique and powerful probe\ninto the large-scale structures of the Universe. Removing the shape noise from\nthe observed WL field, i.e., denoising, enhances the potential of WL by\naccessing information at small scales where the shape noise dominates without\ndenoising. We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative\nadversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance\nof denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations,\nwhich serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000\nmaps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models\ncan fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we\nmeasure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point\nprobability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering\ntransform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all\nstatistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales within\nroughly $0.3 \\sigma$ level at the scales accessible from current and future WL\nsurveys. We also conduct the stress tests on the trained model; denoising the\nmaps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the\ndata used in training. The performance degrades at small scales, but the\nstatistics can still be recovered at large scales. Though the training of DM is\nmore computationally demanding compared with GAN, there are several advantages:\nnumerically stable training, higher performance in the reconstruction of\ncosmological statistics, and sampling multiple realisations once the model is\ntrained. It has been known that DM can generate higher-quality images in\nreal-world problems than GAN, the superiority has been confirmed as well in the\nWL denoising problem.\n",

In\nthis work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model\nparticles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we refine\nthe scalaron decay rate into photons. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of\ndark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation\nproduced by these decays. We also estimate the contribution of primordial\nthermal scalarons to the present dark matter density and find it to be\nnegligible. This supports the original scenario in which the scalaron dark\nmatter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.\n",

    "title": "Evidence for Core-Core Collision in Barnard 68",
    "summary": "  The prestellar core Barnard 68 (B68) is a prototypical source to study the\ninitial conditions and chemical processes of star formation. A previous\nnumerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main\nbody of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping\nobservations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were\nmade with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and\nchannel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected.\nThe velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a\nsolid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the\nbullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the\nvelocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet\nis most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical\nnon-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the\nradial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated\nintensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\\prime\\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from\nthe core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger\nthan 60$^{\\prime\\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is\nenhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock\nwaves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core. In\nconclusion, based on the kinematical and chemical analysis, our observational\nresults support the previously proposed core-core collision scenario in B68.\n",

    "title": "Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to\n  Neutrino-cooled Flows",
    "summary": "  When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in\na tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a\nmassive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas\nforms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and\ntemperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be\nconverted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional,\ngeneral-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a\nnon-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended\naccretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star.\nThe impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by\napproximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an\nadiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low\naccretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak\nmagnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic\nfield mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the\natmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the\naccretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these\nresults with more general initial conditions and describing the main features\nof the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of\nhypercritically accreting NSs.\n",

    "summary": "  The first simultaneous observations of the Fe XVIII 974.86 {\\AA} and Fe XX\n721.56 {\\AA} forbidden lines from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal\nEnvironment (SPICE) spectrograph on Solar Orbiter are presented. The lines were\nobserved from the post-flare loops of an M2.5 class solar flare that peaked at\n23:49 UT on 2024 March 23. The Fe XX/Fe XVIII ratio is used to derive a\ntemperature space-time map for the flaring period, with values ranging from 8\nto 20 MK. The map reveals repeated episodes of heating at the SPICE slit\nlocation over a 30 min period. For one location with the brightest emission,\nthe plasma cooled from 10 MK to 8 MK in 5 min which is longer than the expected\nconductive cooling time of 170 s, suggesting continued background heating\nduring the cooling period. Doppler shifts of between 0 and +10 km/s were\nobtained with precisions of 1-4 km/s, but the accuracies are lower due to\nuncertainties over the absolute wavelength calibration hence we can not\nconclude there are plasma flows in the flare loops. The widths of the two lines\nwere found to be close to the instrumental widths with no evidence of\nnon-thermal broadening, although this result is limited by the instrument\nresolution. The Fe XVIII and Fe XX lines have high signal-to-noise with only a\n5 s exposure time, demonstrating that the lines will be valuable for\nhigh-cadence flare studies with SPICE.\n",

Using its\nfiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\\rho_t$) has a major\npeak around $(1.7-2.0)\\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing\nall existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\\rho_0$\nconsistent with the indication about $\\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan\nExperiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\\rho_t$ to\n$(3.0-6.0)\\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\\sigma$ can constrain more\nstringently the posterior PDF($\\rho_t$), $F_{\\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\\rm{QM}}$ and\nseveral high-density hadronic EOS parameters.\n",

    "title": "Reduced solar quadrupole moment compensates for lack of asteroids in\n  long-term solar system integrations",
    "summary": "  State-of-the-art long-term solar system integrations include several second\norder effects such as the Sun's quadrupole moment J2 and a contribution from\nasteroids (plus the Moon and general relativity). We recently showed that\nincluding 10 asteroids and a reduced J2 in our astronomical solutions provides\nthe best match with geologic data to -58 Myr. However, the rationale for the\nreduced J2 remained ambiguous and may suggest that parameters for long-term\nintegrations compatible with geologic observations are not fully compatible\nwith our knowledge of the current solar system (specifically J2). Here we show\nthat a reduced J2 compensates for a diminished asteroid population in long-term\nsolar system integrations, which may appear surprising. We present an analysis\nand offer a mechanism for the long-term compensating effects of J2 and asteroid\nmass in the solar system (not planetary systems in general). Our analysis\nsuggests that \"differential effects\" on specific secular frequencies involved\nin resonant terms (i.e., (g4-g3) and (s4-s3)), are critical in the long term,\nrather than short-term effects on the orbital elements of individual planetary\norbits across the board. Also, our results indicate that if long-term\nintergrations including the full asteroid population were computationally\nfeasible, a J2 value (within errors) compatible with our current knowledge of\nthe solar system could be used. Attempts to improve the long-term accuracy of\nastronomical solutions by, e.g., tinkering with initial conditions using\ncurrent/future astronomical observations are futile unless asteroid\ndeficiencies in the solar system model are addressed.\n",

    "title": "Absence of TeV halos around millisecond pulsars",
    "summary": "  TeV halos are extended very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission\naround middle-aged pulsars. So far they have only been found around isolated\npulsars, but it has been suggested that they may also be powered by millisecond\npulsars (MSPs). We searched for VHE gamma-ray emission from MSPs reported by\nradio and GeV gamma-ray observatories in 2565 days of data from the High\nAltitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. We found no significant emission\nfrom individual pulsars. By combining the likelihood profiles of all MSPs\naccessible to HAWC, our analysis suggests that the excess emission around the\nMSP population is consistent with a background. Our result suggests that MSPs\nare not as efficient as isolated pulsars in producing TeV halos. This finding\nhas strong implications on the physics interpretation of the Galactic Center\nGeV excess and high-latitude Galactic diffuse emission.\n",

    "title": "Variable Polarization of WR~31a: Binary Companion or Co-Rotating\n  Interaction Region?",
    "summary": "  WR 31a (Hen 3-519) is likely a post-luminous blue variable (LBV) star that is\nevolving to become a classical Wolf-Rayet star. Multicolor (UBVR)\nphotopolarimetric observations of WR 31a were obtained over nine nights in\nearly 2007. The linear polarization data of WR 31a trace a \"loop\" structure in\na Stokes Q-U diagram, which is similar in all four passbands. After mean\nsubtraction, the four loops align to form a single overall pattern. Such loops\ncan be expected to arise from binary systems. We test the binary hypothesis\nwith two models. The data are fit for a strictly circular orbit to derive an\norbital period of 16.7 d, requiring a high inclination perspective of $i\\sim\n80^\\circ$. We also consider an elliptical orbit under simplifying assumptions,\nyielding a match for $i\\sim 75^\\circ$ with eccentricity $e\\sim 0.5$ and a\nlonger orbital period of about 70 d. The prevalence of binarity among massive\nstars is well-known; the prospect of detecting a binary companion during the\npost-LBV stage of WR 31a would add to an emerging narrative of diverse\ninteractions between massive multiple components as a function of evolutionary\nstage. However, if the loop originates because of a co-rotating interaction\nregion (CIR), then the rotation period could be 8.5 d or 17 d. This would give\nan estimated equatorial rotation speed of 95 or 190 km/s. Either of these is a\nsignificant fraction of the estimated critical speed of rotational break-up at\n320 km/s (for an Eddington factor of $\\Gamma=0$).\n",

    "title": "Extended TeV Halos May Commonly Exist around Middle-Aged Pulsars",
    "summary": "  Extended gamma-ray emission around isolated pulsars at TeV energies, also\nknown as TeV halos, have been found around a handful of middle-aged pulsars.\nThe halos are significantly more extended than their pulsar wind nebulae but\nmuch smaller than the particle diffusion length in the interstellar medium. The\norigin of TeV halos is unknown. Interpretations invoke either local effects\nrelated to the environment of a pulsar or generic particle transport behaviors.\nThe latter scenario predicts that TeV halos would be a universal phenomena for\nall pulsars. We searched for extended gamma-ray emission around 36 isolated\nmiddle-aged pulsars identified by radio and gamma-ray facilities using 2321\ndays of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. Through\na stacking analysis comparing TeV flux models against a background-only\nhypothesis, we identified TeV halo-like emission at a significance level of\n$5.10\\,\\sigma$. Our results imply that extended TeV gamma-ray halos may\ncommonly exist around middle-aged pulsars. This reveals a previously unknown\nfeature about pulsars and opens a new window to identify the pulsar population\nthat is invisible to radio, x-ray, and GeV gamma-ray observations due to\nmagnetospheric configurations.\n",

    "title": "Emergence of wind ripples controlled by mechanics of grain-bed impacts",
    "summary": "  Periodic sediment patterns have been observed on Earth in riverbeds and sand\nand snow deserts, but also in other planetary environments. One of the most\nubiquitous patterns, familiar wind or 'impact' ripples, adorns sand beaches and\narid regions on Earth. The observation of aeolian impact ripples on Mars the\nsame size as their terrestrial counterparts despite a thinner atmosphere raises\nquestions about their formation. Here we show in a numerical simulation that\nthe emergent wavelength of impact ripples is controlled by the mechanics of\ngrain-bed impacts and not the characteristic trajectories of grains above the\nbed. We find that the distribution of grain trajectories in transport is\nessentially scale-free, invoking the proximity of a critical point and\nprecluding a transport-related length scale that selects ripple wavelengths. By\ncontrast, when a grain strikes the bed, the process leading to grain ejections\nintroduces a collective granular length scale that determines the scale of the\nripples. We propose a theoretical model that predicts a relatively constant\nripple size for most planetary conditions. In addition, our model predicts that\nfor high-density atmospheres, such as on Venus, or for sufficiently large sand\ngrains on Earth, impact ripples propagate upwind. Although wind-tunnel and\nfield experiments are needed to confirm the existence of such 'antiripples', we\nsuggest that our quantitative model of wind-blown sediment transport may be\nused to deduce geological and environmental conditions on other planets from\nthe sizes and propagation speeds of impact ripples.\n",

All these sources were also\ndetected by the SRG/eROSITA telescope in the 0.2-8 keV energy band, whose data\nhave allowed us to improve their positions and to investigate their X-ray\nspectra. Five of them have been detected in X-rays for the first time, while\nthe remaining ones have already been known previously, but their nature has\nremained unknown. We have taken optical spectra for nine sources with the 1.6-m\nAZT-33IK telescope at the Sayan Observatory (the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial\nPhysics, the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences); for two more\nobjects we have analyzed the archival spectra from SDSS and the 6dF survey. The\nobjects are classified as Seyfert galaxies (seven Sy1, three Sy1.9, and one\nSy2) at redshifts $z$=0.029-0.258. Our analysis of the X-ray spectra has\nrevealed a noticeable intrinsic absorption ($N_{\\rm H} \\sim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$)\nin two of the four Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy1.9-2). The spectrum of one more of\nthem (SRGA J000132.9+240237) cannot be described within the model of an\nabsorbed Comptonization continuum, which may point to a strong absorption and a\nsignificant contribution of the reflected radiation. However, the available SRG\nall-sky survey data are not enough to obtain reliable constraints on the\nabsorption column density in this object, which is also interesting in that it\nis radio loud. Longer X-ray observations are required to refine the physical\nproperties of this active galactic nucleus.\n",

    "title": "superB/NRPy: Scalable, Task-Based Numerical Relativity for 3G\n  Gravitational Wave Science",
    "summary": "  Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and\ncomputationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The\nPython-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR,\nincluding the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages\ncurvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios.\nHistorically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To\naddress this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that\nenables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory\nCharm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the\nstructured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its\ncorrectness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP\nversion on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in\ncylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to\n$\\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong\nscaling, achieving an $\\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared\nto the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This\nscalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork\nfor future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme\nparameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates\nwith other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the\ngeneral relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future\ncoupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.\n",

    "title": "Metallicity of Active Galactic Nuclei from ultraviolet and optical\n  emission lines I: Carbon abundance dependence",
    "summary": "  Metallicity ($Z$) estimates based on ultraviolet (UV) emission lines from the\nnarrow-line regions (NLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been found to\ndiffer from those derived from optical lines. However, the origin of this\ndiscrepancy ($ZR$) remains poorly understood. To investigate the source of\n$ZR$, we compiled from the literature the fluxes of narrow near-UV ($1000 <\n\\lambda(\\angstrom) < 2000)$ and optical ($3000 < \\lambda(\\angstrom) < 7000)$\nemission line measurements for a sample of 11 AGNs (9 at $z<0.4$ and 2 at\n$z\\sim2.4$). Metallicity values for our sample were derived using a\nsemi-empirical calibration based on the\n$C43$=log[(\\ion{C{iv}$\\lambda$1549+\\ion{C{iii}]$\\lambda$1909)/\\ion{He}{ii}$\\lambda$1640]\nemission-line ratio and compared with those obtained via direct measurement of\nthe electron temperature ($T_{\\rm e}$-method) and via calibrations based on\noptical emission-lines. The source of the discrepancy was investigated in terms\nof the ionization parameter ($U$), electron density ($N_{\\rm e}$), and carbon\nabundance (C/H). We found a weak correlation between $ZR$, $U$ and $N_{\\rm e}$.\nHowever, a moderate correlation was observed between $ZR$ and direct estimates\nof C/H, suggesting that the previously assumed (C/O)-$Z$ relations in\nphotoionization models used to derive UV carbon-line calibrations may not be\nvalid for AGNs. By combining a large set of abundance estimates for local\nstar-forming regions with those of our AGN sample, we derived a new (C/O)-$Z$\nrelation. Comparisons between the results of photoionization models that assume\nthis new abundance relation and the UV observational data of our sample produce\n$Z$ values derived from the $C43$ index that are consistent with those obtained\nusing the $T_{\\rm e}$-method.\n",

    "title": "Chromatic Effects on the PSF and Shear Measurement for the Roman Space\n  Telescope High-Latitude Wide Area Survey",
    "summary": "  Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is a key cosmological probe that requires\nprecise measurement of galaxy images to infer shape distortions, or shear, and\nconstrain cosmology. Accurate estimation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is\ncrucial for shear measurement, but the wavelength dependence of the PSF\nintroduces chromatic biases that can systematically impact shear inference. We\nfocus on biases arising from spectral energy distribution (SED) differences\nbetween stars, used for PSF modeling, and galaxies, used for shear measurement.\nWe investigate these effects in $\\textit{Roman's}$ four design reference\nmission WL bands (Y106, J129, H158, F184) and wide filter (W146). Using\n$\\textit{Roman}$-like image simulations, we quantify the induced shear biases\nand compare them to requirements on those biases. Multiplicative biases over\nall galaxies hover around $\\sim$0.2% in the WL bands and 2% in the wide filter,\nexceeding the mission requirement of $|m| < 0.032\\%$ and relaxed requirement of\n$|m| < 0.1\\%$. In individual redshift bins, biases can reach\n0.4$\\unicode{x2013}$0.9% for the WL bands and 3$\\unicode{x2013}$6% for the wide\nfilter. Additive biases remain acceptable in the WL bands but exceed systematic\nlimits in the wide filter. We develop and test PSF-level corrections, showing\nthat a first-order correction reduces biases within survey requirements for the\nWL bands; however, higher-order terms are necessary for the wide filter. Our\nresults highlight the necessity of chromatic corrections for precision WL with\n$\\textit{Roman}$ and provide a framework for mitigating these biases. Finally,\nwe compare analytical color-based corrections to self-organizing maps (SOMs)\nand find that both methods effectively reduce biases.\n",

We present a first study of Roman's prospects\nfor reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through\npopulation-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true\nunderlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will\nbe able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of\nmagnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth.

    "title": "Discovering the Dispersion of Gravitational Waves using Multi-Band\n  Observation including Deci-Hertz: A Unique Probe to Cosmic Acceleration",
    "summary": "  The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the\ngeneral theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic\nacceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative\ntheories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a\nfrequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than\naccessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band\nobservation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational\nwave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based\ndetectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including\nLISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale\nassociated with effective theory of gravity with a precision of approximately\n$8.6\\%$ by combining only $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ high SNR multi-band gravitational\nwave events. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more\nevents as $\\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an\nunexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into\nthe phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave\ndetector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of\nfundamental physics.\n",

    "summary": "  AT 2019aalc is a peculiar sequence of highly variable emission events\nobserved towards the nucleus of the broad-line AGN SDSS J152416.66+045119.0.\nThe system exhibited two distinct UV/optical flares (the first detected in\n2019, the second one in 2023). Spectra obtained following the detection of the\nsecond flare revealed prominent Bowen fluorescence and high-ionization coronal\nemission lines, which were much weaker, if at all detectable, in a spectrum\ntaken following the first flare. We present and analyze a large set of\nmulti-wavelength, multi-epoch data for this source, with particular emphasis on\noptical spectroscopic monitoring conducted with the Las Cumbres Observatory\nnetwork. During the relatively slow dimming that followed the second optical\nflare, the UV/optical light-curve shows a sequence of minor rebrightening\nevents, while the Bowen fluorescence and the coronal lines vary (roughly) in\ntandem with these \"bumps\" in the broad-band light-curve. Most of the observed\nbehavior of AT 2019aalc links it to the growing class of Bowen fluorescence\nflares (BFFs) while setting it apart from canonical tidal disruption events.\nHowever, AT 2019aalc has some outstanding peculiarities, including two short\nflares seen in its soft X-ray light-curve during the dimming phase of the\nsecond optical flare, and which do not seem to be linked to the emission line\nvariations. We discuss the optical and X-ray properties of the source and\npossible scenarios of the origin of the flare, in particular radiation pressure\ninstabilities in the (pre-existing) AGN accretion disk.\n",

    "summary": "  The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars\nwithin the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our\nunderstanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further\nexacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\\rm Q}\\lesssim 10^6$\nyears, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed\nin the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based\non the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable\nobscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our\nsightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime\nmeasurements for six quasars at $z \\sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular\nemission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very\nLarge Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended\nLy$\\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small\nproximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between\nthe SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the\nindependent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption\nsystem prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which\nthus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our\nresults provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode\nhas only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.\n",

    "title": "Detailed Simulations of Massive Hierarchical Triple Star Systems -\n  Exploring the impact of the stellar physics on the evolutionary pathways of\n  massive hierarchical triple systems",
    "summary": "  Recent observations estimate that 30% of early B and O-type stars are found\nin triple systems. So far, the evolution of triple star systems has mainly been\nmodeled using fast stellar codes. Their accuracy decreases with increasing\nmass, limiting their reliability for predicting the evolutionary pathways of\nmassive triple systems. We coupled Tres, which by default uses Seba (fast\nstellar code) to Mesa to perform the first simulations of triple systems that\ncombine a triple secular evolutionary code with a detailed, on-the-fly stellar\ncode. After examining the differences between the stellar evolution predicted\nby the two codes, we simulate the evolution of a set of triple systems and\ncompare their predicted evolutionary pathways. The predicted stellar tracks\nbecome increasingly divergent with increasing mass and wind mass loss\nefficiency. The maximal radial extent, crucial for determining whether the\ncomponents of the triple systems interact, differ by up to two orders of\nmagnitude between the two stellar codes in the considered mass range. This\nleads to divergences in the triples evolutionary pathways predicted by mesa and\nseba. Using mesa instead of seba, the minimum period for avoiding inner mass\ntransfer is reduced by three orders of magnitude. This has important\nconsequences for the formation of GW sources through the triple compact object\nchannel. Our simulations offer new insights into the physics of triple systems,\nas key processes (mass loss, radial expansion, precession) are treated\nself-consistently. They indicate that the results of triple systems population\nsynthesis studies must be interpreted cautiously, in particular when the\nconsidered masses are outside the range of the grid the fast codes are based on\nand when significant stellar winds are considered.\n",

    "title": "Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces\n  Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884",
    "summary": "  We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for\nmapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous\nmethods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves--which contain limited\ninformation about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits\nas probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it\ncreates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot\nproperties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar\nvariability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map\nrepresentation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of\nStarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for\nspot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data\nexperiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar\norientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle\nevolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method\nto TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot\nconcentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based\napproach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing\nconstraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of\nrotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet\ncharacterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from\nplanetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic\nactivity patterns.

    "title": "Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and\n  viscosity",
    "summary": "  Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in\nfuture and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events\nGW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their\ncreation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of\ndark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the\ncriterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny\nendoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host.\nThe EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the\nhost or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and\npoorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and\nviscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and\nmagnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the\neffects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion\ncould be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled\naccretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of\nwhich depends on the mass and spin of the host.\n",

    "title": "Parameter Inference of Black Hole Images using Deep Learning in\n  Visibility Space",
    "summary": "  Using very long baseline interferometry, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)\ncollaboration has resolved the shadows of two supermassive black holes. Model\ncomparison is traditionally performed in image space, where imaging algorithms\nintroduce uncertainties in the recovered structure. Here, we develop a deep\nlearning framework to perform parameter inference in visibility space, directly\nusing the data measured by the interferometer without introducing potential\nerrors and biases from image reconstruction. First, we train and validate our\nframework on synthetic data derived from general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations that vary in magnetic field state,\nspin, and $R_\\mathrm{high}$. Applying these models to the real data obtained\nduring the 2017 EHT campaign, and only considering total intensity, we do not\nderive meaningful constraints on either of these parameters. At present, our\nmethod is limited both by theoretical uncertainties in the GRMHD simulations\nand variation between snapshots of the same underlying physical model. However,\nwe demonstrate that spin and $R_\\mathrm{high}$ could be recovered using this\nframework through continuous monitoring of our sources, which mitigates\nvariations due to turbulence. In future work, we anticipate that including\nspectral or polarimetric information will greatly improve the performance of\nthis framework.\n",

    "title": "A Sequoia stellar candidate with very high 7Li and 9Be",
    "summary": "  Aims. The metal-poor star BPM 3066 belongs to the retrograde halo and\npresents unexpectedly strong spectral features of lithium. To gain insight into\nthe origin of this peculiar abundance, we investigate the chemistry and\nkinematic properties of this star. Methods. We performed a local thermodynamic\nequilibrium chemical abundance analysis of UVES/VLT high-resolution spectra of\nBPM 3066 using ATLAS9 and ATLAS12 model atmospheres and the MyGIsFOS code. We\nfurther characterised the orbital properties of the star by integrating its\norbit and analysing its integrals of motion using the galpy code. Results. The\nstar BPM 3066 shows an exceptional overabundance of both lithium and beryllium.\nThe abundances are A(Li) = 3.0 and A(Be) = 2.1, which are respectively about\n0.8 and 2.2 dex higher than the Li and Be abundances expected at [Fe/H] = -1.5,\nthe metallicity of the star. The observed ratio 7Li/9Be is 7.9, which is close\nto that expected from a synthesis by spallation processes. Overabundances of\nSi, Al, and of the neutron capture elements Sr,Y, Zr, and Ba are also measured.\nKinematically, BPM 3066 has an eccentric, strongly retrograde orbit, confined\nto a height lower than 1 kpc from the galactic plane, and it is a candidate\nmember of the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy. Conclusions. The processes\nleading to the 7Li and 9Be synthesis could have occurred in the environment of\na hypernova. This is supported by some abundance anomalies like the high value\nof Si, [Si/Fe]=1.2 and [Si/O]=1.1. However, the simultaneous high values of N,\nNa, Al, Sc, Ti, and Cu are at odds with the expectations from a hypernova.\nAlternatively, the abundances of BPM 3066 could result from the engulfing of\nrocky planets that were rich in spallated Li and Be. In both cases, it is\nremarkable that such an extreme abundance pattern has been found in a star\nbelonging to the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy.\n",

    "title": "On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in\n  neutron star merger simulations",
    "summary": "  The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about\nnuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help\nus elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about\nthe properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of\nneutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions\nfor these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of\nneutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\\nu$ for the\nnumber of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing\nneutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\\nu)$. Recent simulations\nfocused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve\nneutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\\nu$ over momentum space, preventing\ndirect calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an\nattractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos.\nTheir current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\\nu$: in our\nmost recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst\ncases, estimates of $f_\\nu$ to jump from $f_\\nu=0$ to $f_\\nu\\sim 10^5$. While\nthis is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos\nhas been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid\ndirect calculations of $f_\\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at\nwhich this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively\nsimple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\\nu$\ncan in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a\ncombination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and\nsmoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the\nmerger simulation uses.\n",

    "title": "Turning a negative neutrino mass into a positive optical depth",
    "summary": "  Under $\\Lambda$CDM, recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance\nmeasures from DESI, which favor a low matter density $\\Omega_m$, are in\nmoderate $2-3\\sigma$ tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nobservations. This tension appears alternately as a preference for the sum of\nneutrino masses dropping below the $\\sum m_\\nu = 0.06$eV value required by\nneutrino oscillation measurements to formally negative values; a discrepant\nvalue of $\\Omega_m$ at 0.06eV; or preference for dynamical dark energy beyond\n$\\Lambda$CDM. We show that this tension largely arises from the CMB lensing\nconstraints on the calibration of the sound horizon for geometric measurements\nand relies on the measurement of the reionization optical depth $\\tau$ from\nlarge-angle CMB polarization to set the lensing amplitude. Dropping these\nconstraints removes the neutrino tension at $\\sum m_\\nu=0.06$eV entirely,\nfavoring $\\tau = 0.091\\pm 0.011$ in $\\Lambda$CDM. Beyond $\\Lambda$CDM, it\nbrings the preference for $w_0-w_a$ dynamical dark energy to below $95\\%$ CL.\nWe explore the freedom in interpreting the low-$\\ell$ EE polarization\nconstraint due to analysis choices and reionization modeling beyond the\nstandard step-function assumption and find that this drops the neutrino tension\nin $\\Lambda$CDM to below $95\\%$ CL. Alternately, this raising of $\\tau$ can\nalso be achieved by the same reduction in large-scale curvature fluctuations\nthat also ameliorates the low-$\\ell$ temperature anomaly.\n",

    "summary": "  Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on\ncomparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species.\nHowever, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction\nis vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is\ntypically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of\ntrace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust\nidentification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low\nsignal-to-noise regime. We illustrate these challenges using the sub-Neptune\nK2-18~b, where recent claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish when\nthe considered model space is expanded. We show that numerous alternative\nmodels without potential biosignature gases provide equivalent or better fits\nto the observations. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed\ndetection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model\npreference does not necessarily imply the presence of any specific gas.\n",

    "title": "Biases from Missing a Small Planet in High Multiplicity Systems",
    "summary": "  In an era when we are charting multiple planets per system, one might wonder\nthe extent to which \"missing\" (or failing to detect) a planet can skew our\ninterpretation of the system architecture. We address this question with a\nsimple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove\nplanets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture\nchange. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then\nrepeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying\nhyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as\nfaithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the\nfailure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced\nplanets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially\nunaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is\nthat the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the\nobservation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection\nbias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the\nobserved planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of\nthe Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the\ninterpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular\nspacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary\narchitectures that reproduces these observed patterns.\n",

    "title": "Quantifying the Fermi paradox via passive SETI: a general framework",
    "summary": "  In this paper we consider the extent to which a lack of observations from\nSETI may be used to quantify the Fermi paradox. Building on previous research,\nwe construct a geometrical model to compute the probability of at least one\ndetection of an extraterrestrial electromagnetic (EM) signal of galactic\norigin, as a function of the number $N$ of communicative civilizations. We show\nhow this is derivable from the probability of detecting a single signal; the\nlatter is $\\approx 0.6 \\delta/R$, where $\\delta$ is the distance between the\ninitial and final EM signals and $R$ is the radius of the Milky Way, for\n$\\delta/R \\ll 1$. We show how to combine this analysis with the Drake equation\n$N = \\mathscr{N} \\delta /c$, where $c$ is the speed of light; this implies,\napplying a simplified toy model as an example, that the probability of\ndetecting at least one signal is $>99 \\%$ for $\\delta / c \\gtrsim 10^{2.8}$\nyears, given that $\\mathscr{N} = 1$. Lastly, we list this toy model's\nsignificant limitations, and suggest ways to ameliorate them in more realistic\nfuture models.\n",

    "title": "New {\\em ab initio} constrained extended Skyrme equations of state for\n  simulations of neutron stars, supernovae and binary mergers: I. Subsaturation\n  density domain",
    "summary": "  In numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova and binary neutron stars\nmergers information about the energetics and composition of matter is\nimplemented via external tables covering the huge ranges of thermodynamic\nconditions explored during the astrophysical evolution. More than 120 general\npurpose equation of state tables have been contributed so far. Not all of them\ncomply with current constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear\nphysics and astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Systematic\ninvestigations of the role that dense matter properties play in the evolution\nof these astrophysical phenomena require that more equation of state tables are\nprovided. We build a set of general purpose equation of state tables. At zero\ntemperature, they comply with all currently accepted constraints, including ab\ninitio chiral effective field theory calculations of pure neutron and symmetric\nnuclear matter. This set is designed to explore a wide variety of the behaviors\nof the effective masses as functions of density, which is reflected into a wide\nrange of thermal behaviors. We employ Brussels extended Skyrme interactions\ngenerated by means of Bayesian inference techniques. An extended nuclear\nstatistical equilibrium model is developed for modeling sub-saturated\ninhomogeneous nuclear matter. We study the properties of sub-saturated\ninhomogeneous nuclear matter over wide ranges of density, temperature and\nproton fraction. We analyze the mechanisms of transition to homogeneous matter\nand estimate the transition density. Our key results include the presence of a\nthink $^{14}$He layer in the inner crusts of (neo-)neutron stars, significant\nabundance of other exotic isotopes of H and He in warm and neutron rich matter\nand a detailed study of the thermodynamic stability of cold stellar matter. The\nequation of state tables will be publicly available in the Compose online\ndatabase.\n",

    "title": "The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: First\n  Detection of Mid-Infrared Lags in Prototypical IMBHs in NGC 4395 and POX 52",
    "summary": "  The search for robust evidence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is\ncrucial for understanding black hole seeding process and the formation of\nsupermassive black holes in the early Universe. NGC 4395 and POX 52 are two\nprototypical IMBH hosts, both exhibiting multi-line evidence of low-mass black\nhole activity. Here, we report the first detection of mid-infrared (MIR) lags\nin response to optical variability, with measurements of $3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9}$\ndays for NGC 4395 and $35.2^{+14.2}_{-11.7}$ days for POX~52 at $3.4$ $\\mu$m,\nrespectively, using archival optical data and observations from the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This detection provides the first\nreverberation evidence of low-mass black hole activity in POX 52. The time lags\nof these two low-mass, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) generally\nfollow the extent of the $R_{\\rm dust}-L_{\\rm 5100}$ relation found in\nhigher-mass AGNs. Based on an empirical relation between the broad-line region\nand dusty torus size, we constrain the black hole mass of POX 52 to log($M_{\\rm\nBH}$/$M_\\odot$) = 5.5 $\\pm$ 0.37 (systemic and statistical errors), confirming\nits IMBH nature. Furthermore, long-term optical continuum monitoring of POX 52\nreveals a mild inter-band lag of $\\lesssim$ 1 day. However, no significant\nintranight variability was detected during its one-night, high-cadence\nmonitoring, which we attribute to the longer duty cycle of fast variability in\nPOX 52 compared to that in NGC 4395.\n",

    "summary": "  We present the results from our multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the\ntransient AT2022wtn, discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus\nof SDSSJ232323.79+104107.7, the less massive galaxy in an active merging pair\nwith a mass ratio of ~10:1. AT2022wtn shows spectroscopic and photometric\nproperties consistent with a X-ray faint N-strong TDE-H+He with a number of\npeculiarities. Specifically, a 30-days long plateau at maximum luminosity, a\ncorresponding dip in temperature and the development of a double-horned N III+\nHe II line profile. Strong and time-evolving velocity offsets in the TDE broad\nemission lines and the detection of a transient radio emission, indicate the\npresence of outflows. Overall, the observed properties are consistent with the\nfull disruption of a low-mass star by a ~10$^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$ SMBH followed by\nan efficient disk formation and the launch of a quasi-spherical reprocessing\nenvelope of fast expanding outflowing material. The observed differences\nbetween the He II and the Hydrogen and N III lines can be explained either with\na spatial separation of the lines emitting region or with a late-time reveal of\nshocks from the returning debris streams, as the photosphere recedes. Finally,\nwe present an extensive analysis of the hosting environment and discuss the\nimplications for the discovery of two TDEs in interacting galaxy pairs, finding\nindication for an over-representation of TDEs in these systems. The AT2022wtn\nhost galaxy properties suggest that it is in the early stages of the merger,\ntherefore we may be witnessing the initial enhanced rate of TDEs in interacting\ngalaxies before the post-starburst phase.\n",

    "summary": "  We present the results of the broadband timing and spectral analysis of the\npoorly understood SMC pulsar RX J0032.9-7348 (= SXP 7.02) using NuSTAR and\nNICER observations during its X-ray brightening in 2024. Our timing analysis\nrevealed a pulsation period of approximately 7.02 s in the X-ray light curve.\nThe pulse profile obtained in the broad energy range is double-peaked and\nasymmetric in nature and shows moderate variation with the energy. An absorbed\npower-law model describes the 0.5-8 keV NICER spectra well. The 3-50 keV NuSTAR\nspectrum is best described with an absorbed power-law modified with a\nhigh-energy cutoff model. We find no evidence of iron or cyclotron line\nfeatures in the energy spectrum. During our observation period, the 0.5-50 keV\nluminosity varies in the range of $\\sim 8\\times10^{36} - 4\\times10^{37}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. We also discuss the dependence of spectral parameters on the\nrotational phase of the pulsar through phase-resolved spectroscopy.\n",

    "title": "Compact stellar systems hosting an intermediate mass black hole:\n  magnetohydrodynamic study of inflow-outflow dynamics",
    "summary": "  Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole\ndemographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar\nclusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts,\nwhere accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.\nYet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We\ninvestigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and\nmetallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole\naccretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and\nmagnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical\nabundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to\nexplore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the\naccretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude\nrelative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows\ndriven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas.\nWhile enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense\nclumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The\nsystem's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds,\nmasking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived,\nquasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these\nflares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our\nresults naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters\nand provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared\nobservational strategies.\n",

    "summary": "  During the 2022 outburst of SGR 1935+2154, a Fast-Radio-Burst-like event (FRB\n20221014A) and X-ray activities occurred between two spin-up glitches,\nsuggesting these glitches may connect to multiwavelength phenomenology.\nHowever, the mechanisms altering the magnetar's magnetosphere to enable radio\nemission remain unclear. This study presents high-cadence NICER and NuSTAR\nobservations revealing spectral changes in burst and persistent emission.\nHardness ratio and spectral analysis reveal significant changes during an\n\"intermediate flare\" 2.5 hours before FRB 20221014A. This 80-second flare,\nreleasing $>(6.3\\pm0.2)\\times10^{40}$ erg, coincides with a rapid spectral\nsoftening in both burst and persistent emission and a notable decrease in burst\noccurrence rate. The intermediate flare is bright enough to be detected if\nplaced at a few Mpc, and would appear as a fast X-ray transient. This implies\nthat the connection between magnetar X-ray activity and FRBs can be observed in\nthe local Universe. Post-flare burst spectra peak near 5 keV, resembling the\ncharacteristics of the FRB-associated X-ray burst of 2020. Such change\npersisted for a few hours, implying magnetospheric evolution on similar\ntimescales. However, no radio emission was detected from post-flare bursts,\nsuggesting that FRB emission requires conditions beyond peculiar short bursts.\nThe burst waiting times exhibit a broken power-law distribution, likely\nresulting from contamination by enhanced persistent emission. Although the\nbursts appear randomly distributed in the spin phase, the hardness ratio\nprofile as a function of spin phase follows that of the persistent emission,\nindicating that X-ray bursts originate at low altitudes.\n",

    "summary": "  NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as\nseen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude\nweaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and\ngamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive\nblack hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even\nin such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical\nmodels typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some\nfine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark\nmatter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays,\ninducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering\ncross section in the range $\\sigma_{\\rm DM-\\gamma}/m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq\n10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled\nwith IceCube data.

Applying these to the first observed gravitational-wave\nbinary neutron-star merger GW170817, the constraints on the radius of a\n$1.4\\,M_\\odot$ neutron star improve from $R_{1.4} ={12.54^{+1.05}_{-1.54}} \\,\n{\\rm km}$ to $R_{1.4} = 12.11^{+0.91}_{-1.11} \\,{\\rm km}$ and those on the\ntidal deformability from $\\tilde{\\Lambda}_{1.186} < 720$ to\n$\\tilde{\\Lambda}_{1.186} = 384^{+306}_{-158}$ ($90\\%$ confidence intervals) at\nthe events measured chirp mass $\\mathcal{M}=1.186\\,M_\\odot$. We also show these\npriors can be used to perform model selection between binary neutron star and\nneutron star-black hole mergers; in the case of GW190425, the results provide\nonly marginal evidence with a Bayes factor $\\mathcal{BF}=1.33$ in favour of the\nbinary neutron star merger hypothesis. Given their ability to improve the\nastrophysical inference of binary mergers involving neutron stars, we advocate\nfor these physics-informed priors to be used as standard in the literature and\nprovide open-source code for reproducibility and adaptation of the method.\n",

Using SDSS DR12\nCMASS-NGC galaxies and simulated mock catalogs with $\\Omega_m$ varying in the\nrange of 0.25-0.40, we quantify the discriminative power of different\nstatistics via $\\Delta \\chi^2$ measurements.

Especially,\nadding the $\\bar{D}_{\\rm nei}$-weighting statistics enhances $\\Delta \\chi^2$ by\n39%-130%, while adding the $1/\\bar{D}_{\\rm nei}$-weighted statistics yields\n229%-336% gains over solely using the traditional angular statistics. These\nfindings align with 3D correlation function studies \\cite{Yin+etal+2024},\nconfirming the superior performance of $\\beta$-cosmic-web weighted statistics.\nThe thin-redshift-slice approach makes our method particularly relevant for\nslitless surveys (such as Euclid, CSST) where redshift errors challenge\ntraditional 3D analyses.

    "title": "Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter",
    "summary": "  The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in\ncosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN)\nand DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the\nrobust $\\sim2\\,\\sigma$ evidences of the evolution of dark matter in the\ndynamical dark matter (DDM) model,\n$\\omega_{dm}(a)=\\omega_{dm0}+\\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Based on CMB data, we find a\nvery strong linear relation $\\omega_{dma}=-\\omega_{dm0}$, inducing the\nsingle-parameter DDM model, $\\omega_{dm}(a)=\\omega_{dm}a$, where the\n$\\sim2\\,\\sigma$ DDM evidences is well captured and even strengthened. We\ndemonstrate that there are beyond $2\\,\\sigma$ evidences of the coexistence of\nDDM and dynamical dark energy using the combinations of CMB, DESI BAO and\nPantheon+ SN data. In such models, at a beyond $5\\,\\sigma$ confidence level, we\nverify that the universe remains in a matter-dominated state for a substantial\nperiod in the past, accelerate in the distant future and finally becomes\ncompletely dominated by dark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the\nuniverse is the ``Super Rip'' induced by dark matter with an extremely negative\npressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of\ncosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe's evolution.\n",

    "title": "Collisions with tidal disruption event disks: implications for\n  quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions",
    "summary": "  A popular class of models for interpreting quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions\nfrom galactic nuclei (QPEs) invoke collisions between an object on an extreme\nmass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black\nhole. There are strong links between QPE systems and those disks which formed\nfollowing a tidal disruption event (TDE), and at least two events (AT2019qiz\nand AT2022upj) are known to have occurred following an otherwise typical TDE.\nWe show that the fact that these disks were formed following a TDE strongly\nconstrains their properties, more so than previous models have assumed. Models\nbased on steady-state AGN-like disks have mass contents which grow strongly\nwith size $M_{\\rm disk}\\propto R_{\\rm out}^{7/2}$ and do not conserve the mass\nor angular momentum of the disrupted star. A very different scaling must be\nsatisfied by a TDE disk in order to conserve the disrupted stars angular\nmomentum, $M_{\\rm disk} \\propto R_{\\rm out}^{-1/2}$. These constraints\nsubstantially change the predicted scaling relationships between QPE\nobservables (luminosity, duration, energy, temperature) and the QPE period.\nThey also allow QPE observables to be written in terms of the properties of the\ntwo stars assumed to be involved (the one tidally disrupted and the one on an\nEMRI), making plausibility tests of these models possible. We show that these\nmodifications to the disk structure imply that (i) QPEs cannot be powered by\ncollisions between an orbiting black hole and a TDE disk, (ii) QPEs also cannot\nbe powered by collisions between the surface of a stellar EMRI and a TDE disk.\nA framework in which the collisions are between a TDE disk and a star which has\npuffed up to fill its Hills sphere with a trailing debris stream (as seen in\nrecent simulations) cannot be ruled out from the data, and should be the focus\nof further study.\n",

    "summary": "  Coronal heating has puzzled solar physicists for decades. The question of why\nthe Sun's upper atmosphere is significantly hotter than its lower atmosphere\nremains a key mystery. It is commonly believed that the source of coronal\nheating comes from the Sun's magnetic field, and more complex magnetic dynamics\nis more efficient in heating. In an earlier work we studied the secondary (or\nfiner-scale) flux emergence identified in five ephemeral regions (ERs),\nselected during the last solar minimum (Yang et al. 2024). Here we further\nexplore the atmospheric response to the secondary flux emergences (SFEs) that\nwere identified in the first paper. We further reveal that approximately 80\npercent of the 172 identified SFEs are associated with atmospheric heating\nevents. The heating is most likely associated with magnetic reconnection\ninvolved in the SFE. Overall, a solar quiet region is heated by several hundred\nthousand degrees, during flux emergence of an ER.\n",

    "summary": "  Rapid uniformly-rotating neutron stars are expected to be formed for instance\nin the collapse of some massive stars, the accretion of some compact object\nbinaries, and some double neutron star mergers. The huge amount of the\nrotational energy has been widely believed to be the source of some cosmic\ngamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. Benefited from the tight\nconstraints on the equation of state of the neutron star matter set by the\nlatest multi-messenger data, the chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) and\nperturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), here we present the maximum\ngravitational mass as well as the kinetic rotational energy for a neutron star\nat a given spin period. Our nonparametric EOS analysis reveals that the\ncritical Keplerian configurations ($\\Omega_{\\rm kep}^{\\rm\ncrit}=1.00\\pm0.07\\times 10^{4}~ {\\rm rad/s}$) can sustain maximum gravitational\nmasses of $M_{\\rm kep}^{\\rm crit}=2.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09} M_\\odot$ with\ncorresponding rotational energy reaching $E_{\\rm rot,kep}^{\\rm\ncrit}=2.38^{+0.25}_{-0.24}\\times 10^{53}$. However, the maximum rotational\nenergy that can be feasibly extracted from a neutron star is limited to\n$1.40^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\\times 10^{53}$ erg, which holds for a baryon mass of\n$2.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}M_\\odot$. All these parameters, obtained via the\nnonparametric reconstruction of the equation of state, are at the $68.3\\%$\nconfidence level and the adoption of a quarkonic model yields rather similar\nresults. These findings are found to have already set some intriguing\nconstraints on the millisecond magnetar interpretation of some exciting data.\n",

Point clouds are\ninteractive and allow for zooming, tossing, and turning. Picking a data point\nis enabled by providing a structured view of the set, arranged by a key\nproperty. This arrangement is achieved by autoencoding.\n",

    "summary": "  Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate\nlensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial\nspectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and\nrelated mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models\nwhich are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to\nnearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and\nrunning of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these\nmodels, which are agnostic about power suppression, with various data sets and\nshow that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at\nlow multipoles. We then analyse the significance of these findings using\ninformation criteria. Further, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate\nfuture CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models. We\nconclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power\nsuppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.\n",

    "title": "Dynamical Dark Energy in the Crosshairs: A Joint Analysis with DESI,\n  Pantheon plus, and TDCOSMO Constraints",
    "summary": "  The cosmological tensions between early- and late-Universe probes,\nparticularly the Hubble tension ($H_0$) and $S_8$ discrepancy, challenge the\nvalidity of the standard ${\\rm{\\Lambda}CDM}$ model. Motivated by these\ntensions, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis of three representative\ndark energy models - ${\\rm{\\Lambda}CDM}$, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)\nparametrization, and the Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) model -\nusing the latest observational datasets: baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)\nmeasurements from DESI Data Releases 1 and 2 (DR1/DR2), the Pantheon Plus\nsample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and time-delay cosmography from TDCOSMO\nlensing. Our multi-probe approach breaks key degeneracies among cosmological\nparameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, and $M_B$) and provides robust constraints on dark\nenergy dynamics. The CPL model yields a statistically significant improvement\nover ${\\rm{\\Lambda}CDM}$, with $\\Delta \\chi^2 \\approx -3.6$ for DESI\nDR2+Pantheon Plus+TDCOSMO, favoring a quintessence-like behavior\n($w_0=-0.87^{+0.045 }_{-0.045} $, $w_a=-0.41^{+ 0.28}_{-0.28}$ at 1$\\sigma$\nconfidence level). In contrast, the PEDE model exhibits severe tension with\nobservations, yielding $\\Delta \\chi^2 \\approx +53.1$ (DR1) and $\\Delta \\chi^2\n\\approx +132.3$ (DR2), despite its potential to marginally alleviate the $H_0$\ntension. DESI DR2 tightens constraints on dynamical dark energy by $\\sim$40\\%,\nreinforcing evidence for redshift-evolving $w(z)$. Remarkably, our results\ndemonstrate that such data combination can achieve precision comparable to\nPlanck CMB measurements for dynamical dark energy studies, while offering\ncomplementary advantages in probing the late-time universe. This synergy\nbetween different observational data significantly enhances our ability to\nconstrain dark energy properties.\n",

    "title": "Towards model-independent identification of lensed gravitational waves\n  using Kramers-Kronig relation",
    "summary": "  Observations of microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by compact\nbinary coalescences (CBCs) are essential for studying the mass density\ndistribution in the universe, including black holes and dark matter halos.\nHowever, no confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date.\nThere are two important challenges in the identification of microlensed GWs.\nThe first is that the source waveform and lens structure models are not known\na-priori. The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic\nmicrolensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we\npropose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems.\nWe argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying\ncausality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the\nfact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK\nrelation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it.\nThis, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing\nmicrolensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a\nmethodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized\nconditions.\n",

    "title": "Evolution of the inner accretion flow and the white-dwarf spin pulse\n  during the 2023 outburst in GK Persei",
    "summary": "  We present our X-ray and optical observations performed by NICER, NuSTAR, and\nTomo-e Gozen during the 2023 outburst in the intermediate polar GK Persei. The\nX-ray spectrum consisted of three components: blackbody emission of several\ntens of eVs from the irradiated white-dwarf surface, a source possibly\nincluding several emission lines around 1 keV, and multi-temperature\nbremsstrahlung emission from the accretion column. The 351.3-s white-dwarf spin\npulse was detected in X-rays, and the observable X-ray flux from the column\ndrastically decreased at the off-pulse phase, which suggests that the\nabsorption of the column by the accreting gas called the curtain was the major\ncause of the pulse. As the system became brighter in optical, the column became\nfainter, the pulse amplitude became higher, and the energy dependence of pulses\nbecame weaker at $<$8~keV. These phenomena could be explained by the column's\nmore pronounced absorption by the denser curtain as mass accretion rates\nincreased. The blackbody and line fluxes rapidly decreased at the optical\ndecline, which suggests the expansion of the innermost disk edge with\ndecreasing accretion rates. The electron scattering or the column geometry may\nbe associated with almost no energy dependence of high-energy pulses. The\nirradiated vertically-thick structure at the disk may generate optical QPOs\nwith a period of $\\sim$5700 s.\n",

    "title": "Reevaluating UMa3/U1: star cluster or the smallest known galaxy?",
    "summary": "  Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest Milky Way satellite\ndiscovered to date, exhibiting a half-light radius of 3 $\\pm$ 1 pc and an\nabsolute V-band magnitude of +2.2 $\\pm$ 0.4. Previous studies suggest UMa3/U1\nis a dwarf galaxy, based on its large internal velocity dispersion and the\nimprobability (indicated by dynamical cluster simulations) of its long-term\nsurvival if it were a dark-matter-free star cluster. In this paper, we model\nthe evolution of UMa3/U1 as a star cluster using collisional N-body simulations\nthat include a description of stellar evolution and the external tidal field of\nthe Milky Way, with some simulations including primordial binaries. We find\nthat UMa3/U1 has a substantial remaining lifetime of 2.7 $\\pm$ 0.4 Gyr,\nprimarily due to the retention of compact stellar remnants within the cluster.\nThis retention is facilitated by mass segregation and the preferential loss of\nlow-mass stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed large velocity\ndispersion of UMa3/U1 can be successfully reproduced. These results support the\npossibility that UMa3/U1 is a self-gravitating star cluster. Our simulations\nreveal that modelling UMa3/U1 as a dark matter free star cluster produces a\nmarkedly altered present-day mass function, driven by a strong depletion of\nlow-mass stars. However, the degree of mass segregation among the visible stars\nis not statistically significant. We therefore recommend that future\nobservations of UMa3/U1 and other very small Milky Way satellites focus on\nmeasuring their present-day mass functions to determine their nature.\n",

    "title": "The new compact triple system: discovery of bright third star around\n  contact binary using LAMOST-MRS spectra and photometry",
    "summary": "  We present a study of the third star orbiting around known contact eclipsing\nbinary J04+25 using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) and\npublicly available photometry. This is a rare case of a hierarchical triple,\nwhere the third star is significantly brighter than the inner contact\nsubsystem. We successfully extracted radial velocities for all three\ncomponents, using the binary spectral model in two steps. Third star radial\nvelocities have high precision and allow direct fitting of the orbit. The low\nprecision of radial velocity measurements in the contact system is compensated\nby large number statistics. We employed a template matching technique for light\ncurves to find periodic variation due to the light time travel effect (LTTE)\nusing several photometric datasets. Joint fit of third star radial velocities\nand LTTE allowed us to get a consistent orbital solution with\n$P_3=941.40\\pm0.03$ day and $e_3=0.059\\pm0.007$. We made estimations of the\nmasses $M_{\\rm 12,~3}\\sin^3{i_3}=1.05\\pm0.02,~0.90\\pm0.02~M_\\odot$ in a wide\nsystem and discussed possible determination of an astrometric orbit in the\nfuture data release of Gaia. Additionally, we propose an empirical method for\nmeasuring a period and minimal mass of contact systems, based on variation of\nthe projected rotational velocity ($V\\sin{i}$) from the spectra.\n",

    "title": "Searching beyond the fiducial stochastic gravitational wave background\n  in pulsar timing array data using likelihood reweighting",
    "summary": "  Since the recent announcements of evidence for a stochastic gravitational\nwave background from several pulsar timing array collaborations, much effort\nhas been devoted to explore features beyond the fiducial Hellings-Downs\nbackground including those arising in modified gravity theories and\ndeterministic gravitational wave signals. Inspired by previous studies, we\npropose a method to efficiently screen these models using likelihood\nreweighting based on the fiducial model. In order to alleviate the well-known\nunstable weight estimates in vanilla importance sampling, we implement\nreweighting for the second time making use of the kernel density estimation of\nthe previously reweighted samples. We tested this method by analyzing three\nsimulated datasets with an injected sinusoid signal applied to all pulsars. It\nis found that likelihood reweighting not only gives results compatible with\nthose from full Bayesian analyses when the signal is subdominant, but is also\nable to recover the signal posterior to a reasonable accuracy in the presence\nof a rather strong signal. Given samples from the fiducial model, this method\ncould bring an at least $\\mathcal{O}(10)$-time speedup in analyzing new models.\n",

    "summary": "  AX J145732-5901 is an unidentified X-ray source discovered in the ASCA\nGalactic plane survey. Its extended nature and heavily absorbed X-ray spectrum\nsuggest that AX J145732-5901 is a cluster of galaxies behind the Galactic\nplane. However, due to limited photon statistics, the spectral shape was not\nwell examined. Using the results of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission and\nCosmic X-ray background studies based on the Suzaku observations, we reanalyzed\nthe ASCA data of AX J145732-5901. We confirmed that the source is more extended\nthan the point spread function and the angular size is 14'x10'. The spectrum\nwas heavily absorbed by interstellar matter equivalent to an N_{H} of ~10^{23}\ncm^{-2} and the emission line feature was confirmed. The spectrum was\nrepresented by a thin thermal plasma model with a temperature of 2.6 keV and a\nredshift of 0.12. Assuming the redshift value, the X-ray luminosity is\ncalculated to be 2.6x10^{44} erg s^{-1} in the 1-10 keV energy band. The\nobservational results indicate that AX J145732-5901 is a cluster of galaxies\nbehind the Galactic plane.\n",

    "title": "\"Oh FUors where art thou\": A search for long-lasting YSO outbursts\n  hiding in infrared surveys",
    "summary": "  Long-lasting episodes of high accretion can strongly impact stellar and\nplanetary formation. However, the universality of these events during the\nformation of young stellar objects (YSOs) is still under debate. Accurate\nstatistics of strong outbursts (FUors), are necessary to understand the role of\nepisodic accretion bursts. In this work, we search for a population of FUors\nthat may have gone undetected in the past because they either a) went into\noutburst before the start of modern monitoring surveys and are now slowly\nfading back into quiescence or b) are slow-rising outbursts that would not\ncommonly be classified as candidate FUors. We hypothesise that the light curves\nof these outbursts should be well fitted by linear models with negative\n(declining) or positive (rising) slopes. The analysis of the infrared light\ncurves and photometry of $\\sim$99000 YSO candidates from SPICY yields 717\ncandidate FUors. Infrared spectroscopy of 20 candidates, from both the\nliterature and obtained by our group, confirms that 18 YSOs are going through\nlong-term outbursts and identifies two evolved sources as contaminants. The\nnumber of candidate FUors combined with previously measured values of the\nfrequency of FUor outbursts, yield average outburst decay times that are 2.5\ntimes longer than the rise times. In addition, a population of outbursts with\nrise timescales between 2000 and 5000 days must exist to obtain our observed\nnumber of YSOs with positive slopes. Finally, we estimate a mean burst lifetime\nof between 45 and 100 years.\n",

    "summary": "  The results of the first extragalactic gamma-ray survey by the High Energy\nStereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) are presented. The survey comprises 2720 hours\nof very high-energy gamma-ray observations of the extragalactic sky, recorded\nwith H.E.S.S. from 2004 up to the end of 2012. These data have been re-analysed\nusing a common consistent set of up-to-date data calibration and analysis\ntools. From this analysis, a list of 23 detected objects, predominantly\nblazars, was obtained. This catalogue was assessed in terms of the source class\npopulations that it contains. The level of source parameter bias for the blazar\nsources, probed by this observational dataset, was evaluated using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. Spectral results obtained with the H.E.S.S. data were compared\nwith the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogues to present the full gamma-ray picture of\nthe detected objects. Lastly, this unique dataset was used to assess the\ncontribution of BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars to the\nextragalactic gamma-ray background light at several hundreds of\ngiga-electronvolts. These results are accompanied by the release of the\nhigh-level data to the astrophysical community.\n",

    "summary": "  The dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in the early universe has\nprofound implications for cosmology and particle physics. We systematically\nstudy the steady-state dynamics of bubble walls in scenarios where the\ntransition is first order within three representative beyond the Standard Model\nframeworks, characterised by the presence of an additional scalar in different\nelectroweak representations. Focusing on the local thermal equilibrium regime,\nwe numerically solve the coupled scalar and hydrodynamic equations to extract\nkey properties of the phase transition front: the wall velocity, width, plasma\nand field profiles. Remarkably, we find a near-universal behaviour across\nmodels when expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, that can be\ncaptured by simple fitting functions, useful for phenomenological applications.\nThese results also provide an upper bound on the bubble velocity and represent\nthe first necessary step for the full inclusion of out-of-equilibrium effects.\n",

    "summary": "  Using three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nwith electron and proton thermodynamics, we probe the inner radial and vertical\nstructure of weakly magnetized geometrically thin accretion discs around\nrapidly spinning black holes. We find that the thin, cold disc transitions to a\nthick, hot accretion flow at a radius dependent on the mass accretion rate. At\nhigh accretion rates, the disc truncates close to the innermost stable circular\norbit $r\\approx2r_g$, demonstrating that even in the canonical thin disc model,\nthe plunging region should be treated with two-temperature physics. At\nintermediate accretion rates, the transition radius moves outward by a factor\nof two to $r\\approx 5r_g$, forming a radiatively inefficient inner flow. The\nsimulations also reveal extended cooling along the surface of the disc out to\n$\\sim10r_g$, with 40% of the total cooling at intermediate accretion rates\noccurring above the disc body. These results have implications for X-ray binary\nstate transitions and the physical origin of the X-ray corona.\n",

    "title": "X-ray Spectroscopy via Temporal Decomposition",
    "summary": "  We present a novel way to fit solar flare X-ray spectra that offers more\nsensitivity to physical flare parameters than traditional approaches to\nspectroscopy. We decouple physically distinct emission types in solar flare\nX-ray spectra using timing behaviors, a technique we call time-decomposed\nspectroscopy. By fitting the shapes of particular time series to others across\na time interval, we extract X-ray emission of distinct physical origins before\nany forward modeling. We perform spectroscopy on the original and\ntime-decomposed spectra and find good agreement, with physical reasons for the\nfew disagreements. In general, the time decomposition technique provides more\nprecise results than those of traditional spectroscopy. The thermal and\nnonthermal energies are better constrained by more than an order of magnitude\nusing the time decomposition approach, relative to traditional spectroscopy. We\nexplain mathematically how and why the technique works using the multifractal\nformalism, and show that fractality is one way to choose appropriate light\ncurves for this analysis. We speculate about applications to different\nwavelengths for solar data analysis, as well as applications to other physics\nsubfields and domains.\n",

The variability's\nsignature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for\nthe method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability\nstudies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been\nrealized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and\nscintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena,\nparticularly sub-millisecond optical variability.

    "title": "Ground to Dust: Collisional Cascades and the Fate of Kardashev II\n  Megaswarms",
    "summary": "  Extraterrestrial intelligences are speculated to surround stars with\nstructures to collect their energy or to signal distant observers. If they\nexist, these most likely are megaswarms, vast constellations of satellites\n(elements) in orbit around the hosts. Although long-lived megaswarms are\nextremely powerful technosignatures, they are liable to be subject to\ncollisional cascades once guidance systems start failing. The collisional time\nis roughly an orbital period divided by the covering fraction of the swarm.\nStructuring the swarm orbits does not prolong the initial collisional time as\nlong as there is enough randomness to ensure collisions, although it can reduce\ncollision velocities. I further show that once the collisional cascade begins,\nit can develop extremely rapidly for hypervelocity collisions. Companion stars\nor planets in the stellar system induce perturbations through the Lidov-Kozai\neffect among others, which can result in orbits crossing within some millions\nof years. Radiative perturbations, including the Yarkovsky effect, also can\ndestabilize swarms. Most megaswarms are thus likely to be short-lived on cosmic\ntimescales without active upkeep. I discuss possible mitigation strategies and\nimplications for megastructure searches.\n",

    "title": "Feasibility assessment of optical communications between ground and\n  satellite on Mars through the simulation of atmospheric effects on signal\n  quality leading to a proposal for a new communications network architecture\n  during extreme weather",
    "summary": "  Mars is the next milestone in human exploration. However, there are still\nseveral challenges that must be assessed to ensure appropriate conditions in a\nfuture settlement. Communications services will be essential for this task,\nproviding not only a link between Earth and Mars but also supporting Martian\nweather forecasting and any potential rescue missions. These applications\nrequire a robust, high data rate communications network that allows for rapid\nresponse, remote sensing and public engagement. This research aims to study the\nfeasibility of ground-to-satellite (and vice versa) optical communications\nduring extreme Martian weather conditions, focusing on the link between a\nground station on the surface of Mars and a satellite orbiting the planet.\nLong-lasting and expansive Martian dust storms, particularly common in the\nsouthern hemisphere, pose a considerable challenge when considering the\nfeasibility of optical communications with Mars due to their significant impact\nin terms of signal attenuation and scattering. The methodology of this study is\nbased on a computer simulation of the system featuring the characterisation of\nthe Martian atmosphere and optical link to measure the attenuation and\nundesired effects suffered by the data signal when applying different\nenvironmental configuration parameters. The flexibility of the approach allows\nfor the prediction of communications link quality in extreme cases such as\nglobal dust storms. The simulation is based on atmospheric data from the Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Climate Sounder instrument and considers the\nrecently launched Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The extreme\nconditions during dust storms in the southern polar-hood region lead to the\nproposal of a new communications network architecture to ensure connectivity\nduring these events.\n",

    "summary": "  When testing general relativity (GR) with gravitational wave observations,\nparametrized tests of deviations from the expected strong-field source dynamics\nare one of the most widely used techniques. We present an updated version of\nthe parametrized framework with the state-of-art IMRPhenomX waveform family.\nOur new framework incorporates deviations in the dominant mode as well as in\nthe higher-order modes of the waveform. We demonstrate that the missing physics\nof either higher-order modes or precession in the parametrized model can lead\nto a biased conclusion of false deviation from GR. Our new implementation\nmitigates this issue and enables us to perform the tests for highly asymmetric\nand precessing binaries without being subject to systematic biases due to\nmissing physics. Finally, we apply the improved test to analyze events observed\nduring the second half of the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3b). We\nprovide constraints on GR deviations by combining O3b results with those from\nprevious observation runs. Our findings show no evidence for violations of GR.\n",

    "title": "Predicting Potential Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries\n  Based on Stellar Kinematics in Archival IFU Surveys",
    "summary": "  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies emit\ncontinuous gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies, and ongoing\npulsar timing array (PTA) experiments aim to detect the first individual\nsystem. Identifying the exact host galaxy of a SMBHB detected in GWs is\nparamount for a variety of multi-messenger science cases, but it will be\nchallenging due to the large number of candidate galaxies in the sky\nlocalization region. Here, we apply recent insights on the distinct\ncharacteristics of SMBHB host galaxies to archival galaxy datasets, to predict\nwhich nearby massive galaxies are most likely to host SMBHBs detectable by\nPTAs. Specifically, we use archival galaxy IFU surveys to search for nearby\ngalaxies with distinct stellar kinematic signatures of SMBHB host galaxies, as\ninformed by cosmological simulations. These distinct stellar kinematic\nsignatures, including slow rotation and strong kinematic/photometric\nmisalignments, are a hallmark of recent major galaxy mergers that led to the\nformation of SMBHBs in these galaxies. We produce a list of nearby massive\ngalaxies that may currently host SMBHBs, ranked by a combination of their host\ngalaxy stellar kinematic properties and their hypothetical GW strain. We\ndiscuss how our ranked list can be used (1) for targeted searches for\nindividual sources of continuous GWs by PTAs, (2) to corroborate candidate\nSMBHBs identified through other approaches, and (3) to select candidate\nrecoiling AGN and closely-separated (<100 pc) dual AGN for telescope follow-up\nconfirmation.\n",

    "summary": "  Analyses of the galaxy N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) have a large\nnumber of degrees of freedom, meaning one cannot directly estimate an\ninvertible covariance matrix purely from mock catalogs, as has been the\nstandard approach for the 2PCF and power spectrum. Instead, analyses use\ntemplates based on assuming a Gaussian Random Field density with the true,\nBoltzmann-solver-computed power spectrum. The resulting covariance matrices are\nsparse but have notable internal structure. To understand this structure\nbetter, we seek a fully analytic, closed-form covariance matrix template, using\na power law power spectrum $P(k) \\propto 1/k$. We obtain a simple closed-form\nsolution for the covariance of the 2PCF, as well as closed-form solutions for\nthe fundamental building blocks of the covariance matrices for the 3PCF, 4PCF,\nand beyond. We use our results to present a clearer picture of the covariance\nmatrices' structure and sparsity, corresponding to triangular and\nnon-triangular regions. This will be useful in guiding future NPCF analyses\nwith spectroscopic surveys such as DESI, Euclid, Roman, and SPHEREx.\n",

In this paper,\nwe combine measurements of the dispersion measure ($\\mathrm{DM}$) of fast radio\nbursts (FRB) with the luminosity distance from type Ia supernovae (SNe) to\ninvestigate update constraints on the photon rest mass. We derive the\nexpression of $\\mathrm{DM}$ dependence concerning a non-vanishing photon mass\nfrom a cosmological-model independent approach and constrain the parameter\n$m_{\\gamma}$ from measurements of 68 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from\nthe Pantheon compilation.

    "title": "A Hybrid Mixture of $t$-Factor Analyzers for Clustering High-dimensional\n  Data",
    "summary": "  This paper develops a novel hybrid approach for estimating the mixture model\nof $t$-factor analyzers (MtFA) that employs multivariate $t$-distribution and\nfactor model to cluster and characterize grouped data. The traditional\nestimation method for MtFA faces computational challenges, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional settings, where the eigendecomposition of large covariance\nmatrices and the iterative nature of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms\nlead to scalability issues. We propose a computational scheme that integrates a\nprofile likelihood method into the EM framework to efficiently obtain the model\nparameter estimates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through\nsimulations showcasing its superior computational efficiency compared to the\nexisting method, while preserving clustering accuracy and resilience against\noutliers. Our method is applied to cluster the Gamma-ray bursts, reinforcing\nseveral claims in the literature that Gamma-ray bursts have heterogeneous\nsubpopulations and providing characterizations of the estimated groups.\n",

    "title": "The frozen vanilla model: Exploring dark sector interactions with delta\n  effective theories",
    "summary": "  In this paper, we introduce a new interacting mechanism within the dark\nsector, encompassing both dark energy and dark matter, while grounding our\nanalysis in the familiar framework of the $\\mathrm{\\Lambda CDM}$ model\naugmented by baryons and radiation components, including photons and neutrinos.\nThe interaction between dark energy and dark matter is confined to the\nperturbative level. One significant advantage of this proposal is that all\ngeometric probes yield constraints consistent with the so-called vanilla model\nor the extended vanilla model, where dark energy has a constant equation of\nstate, $w_{x}$. However, the introduction of this new interacting mechanism\naffects several theoretical signatures, involving contrast dark matter and dark\nenergy densities. We perform an exploratory analysis of those effects in the\nCMB power spectra, matter-power spectra, and redshift space distortions. For\ninstance, it allows for a decrease/increment in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe\n(ISW) effect depending on the value taken by the interaction coupling. This\neffect could be observationally detected by looking for a cross-correlation\nbetween the ISW temperature fluctuations and the distribution of galaxies or\nquasars. At late times, the interaction in the dark sector becomes very\neffective, affecting the non-linear scale of structure formation. We discuss\nhow the estimators $f\\sigma_{8}(z)$ and $S_{8}(z)$ are affected by different\ninteracting couplings; indicating that $f\\sigma_{8}(z)$ can show a relative\nchange of up to $15\\%$ compared to the concordance model at low redshifts.\nFinally, we show how the various terms in the dark energy pressure perturbation\n(both adiabatic and non-adiabatic) are relevant for different scales,\ndemonstrating the absence of large-scale instabilities.\n",

    "summary": "  A finite axion-nucleon coupling enables the production of axions in stellar\nenvironments via the thermal excitation and subsequent de-excitation of the\n$^{57}$Fe isotope. Given its low-lying excited state at 14.4 keV, $^{57}$Fe can\nbe efficiently excited in the hot cores of supergiant stars, possibly leading\nto axions emission. The conversion of these axions into photons in the Galactic\nmagnetic field results in a characteristic 14.4 keV line, potentially\ndetectable by hard X-ray telescopes such as NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic\nTelescope Array (NuSTAR). In this work, we present the first constraints on\naxion-nucleon couplings derived from \\textsc{NuSTAR} observations of Betelgeuse\nand discuss the potential insights that could be gained from detecting this\nline in other nearby supergiants.

    "title": "Search for the Optical Counterpart of Einstein Probe Discovered Fast\n  X-ray Transients from Lulin Observatory",
    "summary": "  The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission has revolutionized the\ndetection and follow-up observations of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) by\nproviding prompt and timely access to their precise localizations. In the first\nyear of its operation, the EP mission reports the discovery of 72 high\nsignal-to-noise FXTs. Subjected to the visibility in the sky and weather\nconditions, we search for the optical counterparts of 42 EP-discovered FXTs\nfrom the Lulin observatory. We successfully detect the optical counterparts of\n12 FXTs, and five of those are first discovered by us from the Lulin\nobservatory. We find that the optical counterparts are generally faint (r>20\nmag) and decline rapidly (>0.5 mag per day). We also find that 11 out of 42\nFXTs had shown direct evidence of their association with Gamma-Ray Bursts\n(GRBs) through significant temporal and spatial overlapping. Furthermore, the\nluminosities and redshifts of FXTs with confirm optical counterparts in our\nobservations are fully consistent with the faintest end of the GRB population.\nHowever, the non-detection of any associated optical counterpart with a\nsignificant fraction of FXTs suggests that EP FXTs are likely a subset of\nso-called `Dark' FXTs, similar to `Dark' GRBs. Additionally, the luminosities\nof two FXTs were also consistent with jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs).\nHowever, their luminosities differ significantly from those of typical\nsupernova shock breakout or kilonova emissions. Thus, we conclude that a\nsignificant fraction of EP-discovered FXTs are associated with events having\nrelativistic jets; either a GRB or a jetted TDE.\n",
