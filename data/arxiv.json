    "title": "Galaxy Zoo CEERS: Bar fractions up to z~4.0",
    "summary": "  We study the evolution of the bar fraction in disc galaxies between $0.5 < z\n< 4.0$ using multi-band coloured images from JWST CEERS. These images were\nclassified by citizen scientists in a new phase of the Galaxy Zoo project\ncalled GZ CEERS. Citizen scientists were asked whether a strong or weak bar was\nvisible in the host galaxy. After considering multiple corrections for\nobservational biases, we find that the bar fraction decreases with redshift in\nour volume-limited sample (n = 398); from $25^{+6}_{-4}$% at $0.5 < z < 1.0$ to\n$3^{+6}_{-1}$% at $3.0 < z < 4.0$. However, we argue it is appropriate to\ninterpret these fractions as lower limits. Disentangling real changes in the\nbar fraction from detection biases remains challenging. Nevertheless, we find a\nsignificant number of bars up to $z = 2.5$. This implies that discs are\ndynamically cool or baryon-dominated, enabling them to host bars. This also\nsuggests that bar-driven secular evolution likely plays an important role at\nhigher redshifts. When we distinguish between strong and weak bars, we find\nthat the weak bar fraction decreases with increasing redshift. In contrast, the\nstrong bar fraction is constant between $0.5 < z < 2.5$. This implies that the\nstrong bars found in this work are robust long-lived structures, unless the\nrate of bar destruction is similar to the rate of bar formation. Finally, our\nresults are consistent with disc instabilities being the dominant mode of bar\nformation at lower redshifts, while bar formation through interactions and\nmergers is more common at higher redshifts.\n",

    "title": "Probing the Cores of Subdwarf B Stars: How do They Compare to Cores in\n  Helium Core-Burning Red Giants?",
    "summary": "  The mixing of material from stellar convective cores into their adjacent\nradiative layers has been a matter of long-standing debate. Pulsating subdwarf\nB stars offer excellent conditions to advance our understanding of this\nproblem. In this work we use a model-independent approach to infer information\nabout the cores of three subdwarf B stars and compare it with similar\ninferences from earlier analysis of red giants in the helium core-burning\nphase. This is achieved by fitting an analytical description of the\ngravity-mode pulsation periods to pulsation data collected by the Kepler\nsatellite. From the fits we infer the reduced asymptotic period spacings and\nthe amplitude and position of sharp structural variations associated with\nchemical discontinuities in the stellar interiors. Our results indicate the\npresence of sharp structural variations with similar properties in all three\nstars, located near the edge of the gravity-mode propagation cavity and likely\nassociated with the C-O/He transition. We find that these structural variations\ndiffer systematically from those of helium core-burning red giant stars, having\nlarger amplitudes and being located at a larger buoyancy radius. This suggests\nthat chemical mixing beyond the adiabatically stratified core into the\nradiatively stratified layers may be more extensive in subdwarf B stars than in\nhelium core-burning red giants. Alternatively, the stratification of the mixing\nregion beyond the adiabatically stratified core may differ significantly\nbetween the two types of stars. The model-independent constraints set on the\nstructural variations inside these three stars are the first of a kind and will\nbe key to enhance the modelling of layers adjacent to stellar convective cores\nand to test non-canonical stellar evolution channels leading to the formation\nof hot subdwarf stars.\n",

    "title": "Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime",
    "summary": "  We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test\ngyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to\nthe Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic\nfield strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong\nfield regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near\nrotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes\nand naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to\ndifferentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial\nmodification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the\nspacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic\nfields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends\nsensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the\ncollapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic\nfields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a\nlong-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test\ngyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we\nobtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency in\nmagnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic field enhances\n($\\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the standard $1/r^{5/2}$\nfalloff. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for\nblack holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized\nnear magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field\nbehavior of spin precession could have important implications for transmuted\nblack holes formed via collapse or mergers of magnetized progenitors in both\nastrophysical and cosmological contexts.\n",

    "summary": "  The problem of quasar classification comes in the class of highly imbalanced\nclassification problems since Radio-loud (RL) quasars are rare and make up only\nabout 10% of the quasar population. In this work, we use the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey-DR3 dataset and introduce a PCA-based regression pipeline designed to\nmaximize recall for rare classes in class-imbalanced astronomical data. We\ndemonstrate an effective methodology to identify the key features of the\ndataset and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality\nreduction. For the PCA transformed SDSS-DR3 dataset, first two components\naccount for the 97% of the observed variance. We perform classification of\nRadio-Loud (RL) and Radio-Quiet (RQ) quasars with Random Forest Classifier\n(RFC), novel PCA based balanced linear regression classifier (PBC), Random\nforest integrated with SMOTE classifier and XGBoost classifier with threshold\ntuning. RFC achieves an overall accuracy of 92% while PBC achieves an overall\naccuracy of 62%. XGBoost achieves an overall accuracy of 72% and SMOTE\nintegrated RFC achieves an accuracy of 85%. Higher precision is obtained for RQ\nquasars in all classification methods. For the RL class, RFC achieves a recall\nof 0.04, XGBoost achieves a recall of 0.39, SMOTE integrated RFC achieves a\nrecall of 0.25 and PBC achieves a recall of 0.52 attributed to the balanced\nlogistic regression. RFC and PBC achieve F1 score of 0.08 and 0.19 respectively\nfor RL while XGBoost achieves an improved F1 score of 0.22 but at the cost of\nreduced recall of the RL class. SMOTE integrated RFC achieves a better F1 score\nof 0.21 over RFC and PBC. Overall results of classifiers point to extreme class\nimbalance between RQ and RL classes in the data set.\n",

    "title": "Spinning masters: on the impact of tidal forces and protohalo size on\n  early spin evolution",
    "summary": "  In this work, we explore how the size and surrounding tidal fields of dark\nmatter protohalos at high redshift influence their angular momentum (AM)\nevolution. While tidal torque theory (TTT) states that AM arises from the\nmisalignment between protohalo shape and tidal fields, it remains unclear what\nis the characteristic scale of the perturbations that couple with each\nprotohalo, and its correlation with protohalo properties such as size.\nMoreover, although the assumptions of the TTT are assumed to hold during the\nlinear and quasi-linear regime, cosmological simulations reveal that\ndiscrepancies between its predictions and the true AM of halos emerge earlier\nthan expected. To address this, we analyze cosmological simulations to study\ntidal fields at $z=80$ using different smoothing lengths, and determine which\nbest predicts AM under TTT. We then investigate discrepancies between predicted\nand actual AM across redshifts, considering the effect of evolving tidal and\ninertia tensors. Our results show that the early tidal field couples with the\ninertia tensor of protohalos on scales about half of their characteristic size\nand confirm that disagreements between theory and simulation arise before the\nnon-linear regime, suggesting a systematic effect from protohalo shape\ninteracting with the forming cosmic web.\n",

    "title": "QPO signatures of disk restoration after type-I X-ray bursts from\n  4U~1636$-$536",
    "summary": "  Type-I thermonuclear bursts (TNBs) from neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries\n(NSLMXBs) originate on the neutron star's surface from the unstable burning of\nthe accreted material. On the other hand, kHz quasi-periodic oscillations\n(QPOs) are thought to originate in the innermost regions of the in-spiraling\naccretion disk. Due to the violent nature of the bursts, it is anticipated that\nType-I TNBs will impact the inner accretion flow, and, therefore, the kHz QPOs.\nIn this work, we systematically study the evolution of the upper and the lower\nkHz QPOs immediately before and after a Type-I TNB on 4U 1636$-$536 using\n{\\it{AstroSat}} observations in the 3--20 keV band. The analysis of the\npower-density-spectra show the presence of kHz QPOs within 200 seconds before\nthe onset of the Type--I burst. However, we have not detected any prominent\nsignature of the same within 100-200 second posterior to the burst. The kHz\nQPOs then re-emerges after $\\approx$ 200 sec. The fractional rms variation in\nthe 3--20 keV band drops by $\\approx$ 5-6 \\%, supporting the non-existence of\nkHz QPOs in the 200 sec post-Burst Zone. The time scale of 200 sec coincides\nwith the viscous time scale, highlighting a scenario where the inner disk is\ntemporarily disrupted by the intense radiation from the Type-I TNB. The kHz QPO\nthen re-establishes as the inner disk is restored.\n",

Two methods are used with equivalent results: dynamical\nperturbation of the conservative equations of motion in harmonic coordinates,\nand dynamical perturbation of the conservative Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates.\nThe perturbation of the non-local tail term at 4PN order in both approaches is\ncarefully investigated. Our final gauge invariant result for the location of\nthe ISCO at 4PN order is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift\ncomputed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio\nlimit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity\ncalculation in the case of equal masses. The PN method followed here is\nconsidered in standard Taylor-expanded form, without any resummation techniques\napplied. As a complement, we also compute explicitly the gauge transformation\nfrom harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the\ntail contribution therein.\n",

    "summary": "  Massive neutrinos imprint distinctive signatures on the evolution of cosmic\nstructures, notably suppressing small-scale clustering. We investigate the\nimpact of massive neutrinos on the galaxy bispectrum in redshift-space,\nadopting a spherical harmonic multipole decomposition $B_L^m(k_1, \\mu, t)$,\nthat captures the full angular dependence. We develop an analytical and\nnumerical framework incorporating neutrino-corrected perturbation theory\nkernels and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that the linear\ntriangle configurations are particularly sensitive to massive neutrinos, with\ndeviations reaching up to $\\sim 2\\%$ for a total mass $\\sum m_\\nu =\n0.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. To assess detection prospects in galaxy surveys like\n\\textit{Euclid}, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual\nmultipoles, including the effects of Finger-of-God damping and shot noise. The\nneutrino-induced signatures in $B_0^0$ and $B_2^0$ are found to be detectable\nwith SNR $\\gtrsim 5$ across a range of configurations, even after accounting\nfor small-scale suppression. Higher-order multipoles such as $B_2^1$ and\n$B_2^2$ are moderately sensitive, with SNR $\\gtrsim$ ($2-3$) in squeezed\nlimits, while hexadecapole moments are more suppressed but still exhibit\nmeasurable signals at high $k_1$. Additionally, the SNR generally increases\nwith wave number $k_1$, particularly for squeezed and stretched triangles,\nsuggesting that access to smaller scales significantly enhances detection\nprospects.Our study highlights the potential of the redshift-space bispectrum\nmultipoles as sensitive probes of massive neutrinos, complementing traditional\npower spectrum analyses, and underscores the importance of angular information\nand higher-order statistics for galaxy surveys.\n",

    "title": "Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI:\n  Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks",
    "summary": "  The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central\nrole in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron\nstar mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic\nfield and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of\nsmall-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI\nactivity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex\nmagnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to\nassess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the\nMRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic\nwavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions\nthat include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that\nstrong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI,\nslowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply\nthis extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from\na numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant.\nWe find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant\ntimescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only\nat late times $t\\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that\nthe MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in\npost-merger environments during the first $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.\n",

Employing simple, but efficient,\nparameterizations of the light curve based on a broken power law in terms of\nphysical parameters, fitted to a large dataset of synthetic light curves, we\napply basic machine learning techniques to determine the approximate connection\nbetween key input parameters of the forward shock model and the light curve\nparameters. Solving then the inverse problem, we find that the strength of the\ncentral engine can be reasonably accurately estimated even with very limited\ninformation.

    "title": "Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation",
    "summary": "  In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\n(ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\\rm s}=0.9743 \\pm 0.0034$ for the scalar\nspectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs\ninflationary models at $2\\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian\ninference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with\nnon-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the\nanalysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background\ncollected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic\noscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a\nsingle parameter $R_{\\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the\ncobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the\nmodel parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the\nKullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data,\nyielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data\nprovides $75\\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis\nwithout ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the\naverage equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of\nmagnitude, values in the $95\\,\\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low\nreheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values\ngreater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for\ndust $\\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more\nthan $2\\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of\nparameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high\ndegree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT\nDR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.\n",

    "summary": "  Studying the atmospheres of exoplanets is one of the most promising ways to\nlearn about distant worlds beyond our solar system. The composition of an\nexoplanet's atmosphere can provide critical insights into its geology and\npotential habitability. For instance, the presence of certain molecules such as\nwater vapor, oxygen, or methane have been proposed to indicate the possibility\nof life. From an observation point of view, over the past fifteen years,\nsignificant progress has been made in characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres.\nThis work reviews recent developments in ground-based high-resolution\nspectroscopic instruments that make it possible to analyze distant atmospheres\nin great detail. High-resolution transmission spectroscopy, one of the most\neffective methods used, has examined the atmospheres of Jupiter-like and is\npushing towards the smaller, sub-Neptunian exoplanets. Numerous molecules have\nbeen detected using this technique, including CO,H2O,TiO,HCN,CH4,NH3,C2H2,OH.\nWe explore the intriguing possibilities that lie ahead for future ground-based\ninstrumentation, particularly in the context of detecting biologically relevant\nmolecules within Earth-analog exoplanetary atmospheres including molecular\noxygen (O2). With detailed exposure time calculations for detecting O2 we find\nthat at the same exposure time spectral resolution of 300,000 reaches higher\nsignificance compared to 100,000. The exposure time and therefore the needed\nnumber of transits is reduced by a factor of 4 in challenging haze and cloud\nscenarios.\n",

    "summary": "  Meteor light curves are sometimes known to display flickering: rapid,\nquasi-periodic variations in brightness. This effect is generally attributed to\nthe rotational modulation of the ablation rate, which is caused by the\ntime-varying cross section area presented by a nonspherical rotating meteoroid\nto the oncoming airflow. In this work we investigate the effects that the\nrotation of a meteoroid of given shape (spherical, cubic, or cylindrical) has\non the meteor's light curve, given state-of-the-art experimental laboratory\nestimates of the drag and lift coefficients of hypersonic flow (Mach number >\n5) around various shaped objects. The meteoroid's shape is important in\ndetermining these two forces, due to the different response of the drag and\nlift coefficients according to the angle of attack. As a case study, the model\nwas applied to a fireball observed on 2018 April 17 by the PRISMA network, a\nsystem of all-sky cameras that achieves a systematic monitoring of meteors and\nfireballs in the skies over the Italian territory. The results show that this\nmethodology is potentially able to yield a powerful diagnostic of the rotation\nrate of meteoroids prior to their encounter with the atmosphere, while also\nproviding essential information on their pre-fall actual shapes.\n",

    "title": "Enhancing MHD model accuracy and CME forecasting by constraining coronal\n  plasma properties with Faraday rotation",
    "summary": "  Faraday rotation measurements of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the\nsolar corona serve as a powerful complementary tool for probing the\npre-eruption electron density and magnetic field structure. These measurements\nthereby allow us to refine predictions from global MHD models. In this paper,\nwe discuss our recent study of the morphological evolution of a CME-driven\nshock event that occurred on August 3, 2012. Our analysis used white-light\ncoronagraphic observations from three different vantage points in space (SOHO\nand STEREO A and B). Obtaining data from these spacecraft, we derived key\nparameters such as the radius of curvature of the driving flux rope, the shock\nspeed, and the standoff distance from the CMEs' leading edge. A notable feature\nof this event was the availability of rare Faraday rotation measurements of a\ngroup of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona, which were\nobtained a few hours before the eruption. These observations from the VLA radio\ninterferometer provide independent information on the integrated product of the\nline-of-sight magnetic field component and electron density. By modeling the\nshock standoff distance and using constraints from the Faraday rotation\nmeasurements, we achieve a high level of agreement between the fast-mode Mach\nnumber predicted by the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS)\ncode in its thermodynamic mode and the value deduced from the analysis of the\n3D reconstruction of coronagraphic data, provided that appropriate correction\nfactors (f_b = 2.4 and f_n = 0.5) are applied in advance to scale the simulated\nmagnetic field and electron density, respectively. Our results are consistent\nwith previous estimates and provide critical information for fine-tuning future\nMHD simulations.\n",

    "title": "Forecasting the solar cycle using variational data assimilation:\n  validation on cycles 22 to 25",
    "summary": "  Forecasting future solar activity has become crucial in our modern world,\nwhere intense eruptive phenomena mostly occurring during solar maximum are\nlikely to be strongly damaging to satellites and telecommunications. We present\na 4D variational assimilation technique applied for the first time to real\nsolar data. Our method is tested against observations of past cycles 22, 23, 24\nand on the ongoing cycle 25 for which we give an estimate of the imminent\nmaximum value and timing and also provide a first forecast of the next solar\nminimum. We use a variational data assimilation technique applied to a solar\nmean-field Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamo model. Ensemble predictions\nare produced in order to obtain uncertainties on the timing and value of the\nmaximum of cycle $n+1$, when data on cycle $n$ is assimilated. We study in\nparticular the influence of the phase during which data is assimilated in the\nmodel and of the weighting of various terms in the objective function. The\nmethod is validated on cycles 22, 23 and 24 with very satisfactory results. For\ncycle 25, predictions vary depending on the extent of the assimilation window\nbut start converging past 2022 to a solar maximum reached between mid-2024 up\nto the beginning of 2025 with a sunspot number value of $143.1 \\pm 15.0$.\nRelatively close values of the maximum are found in both hemispheres within a\ntime lag of a few months. We also forecast a next minimum around late 2029,\nwith still significant errorbars. The data assimilation technique presented\nhere combining a physics-based model and real solar observations produces\npromising results for future solar activity forecasting.\n",

    "summary": "  In the present review, we consider the status of the classification of the\nvacuum, stationary and asymptotically flat black holes in scalar-tensor\ngravity. Contrary to the similar problem in general relativity, the black hole\nclassification in scalar-tensor theories is much more challenging due to the\nvery complicated character of the field equations and the very complex\nmathematical structure of the scalar-tensor gravity as a whole. We review most\nof the known no-hair results, and where possible new ones, as well demonstrate\nsome of the difficulties that appear in our attempts to classify the black\nholes within scalar-tensor gravity. The proofs of the theorems and the\nunderlying mathematical techniques are given in sufficient detail. To make the\nreview self-contained we also present the vacuum black hole uniqueness theorems\nin general relativity and their proofs.\n",

    "summary": "  We fit archival near-infrared spectra of 305 brown dwarfs with atmosphere\nmodels from the Sonora and Phoenix groups. Using the parameters of the best-fit\nmodels as estimates for the physical properties of the brown dwarfs in our\nsample, we have performed a survey of how brown dwarf atmospheres evolve with\nspectral type and temperature. We present the fit results and observed trends.\nWe find that clouds have a more significant impact on near infrared spectra\nthan disequilibrium chemistry, and that silicate clouds influence the near\ninfrared spectrum through the late T types. We note where current atmosphere\nmodels are able to replicate the data and where the models and data conflict.\nWe also categorize objects with similar spectral morphologies into families and\ndiscuss possible causes for their unique spectral traits. We identify two\nspectral families with morphologies that are likely indicative of binarity.\n",

In\nthis context, the evolution of the Ricci scalar can lead to the spontaneous\nbreaking of discrete or continuous symmetries through tachyonic instabilities.\nThese Hubble-induced phase transitions may cause the amplification of field\nfluctuations, the formation of transient topological defects, and an efficient\nenergy transfer into relativistic degrees of freedom. We analyze this general\nmechanism and its cosmological consequences, including (re)heating and\ngravitational wave production. As a concrete realization, we discuss the\npostinflationary evolution of the Standard Model Higgs, examining the interplay\nbetween curvature effects, vacuum stability, and non-perturbative dynamics.\nThis framework provides a minimal and predictive connection between high-energy\nphysics and the early Universe, with potential observational signatures.\n",

    "summary": "  We report the discovery and confirmation of two planets orbiting the\nmetal-poor Sun-like star, HD 35843 (TOI 4189). HD 35843 c is a temperate\nsub-Neptune transiting planet with an orbital period of 46.96 days that was\nfirst identified by Planet Hunters TESS. We combine data from TESS and\nfollow-up observations to rule out false-positive scenarios and validate the\nplanet. We then use ESPRESSO radial velocities to confirm the planetary nature\nand characterize the planet's mass and orbit. Further analysis of these RVs\nreveals the presence of an additional planet, HD 35843 b, with a period of 9.90\ndays and a minimum mass of $5.84\\pm0.84$ $M_{\\oplus}$. For HD 35843 c, a joint\nphotometric and spectroscopic analysis yields a radius of $2.54 \\pm 0.08\nR_{\\oplus}$, a mass of $11.32 \\pm 1.60 M_{\\oplus}$, and an orbital eccentricity\nof $e = 0.15\\pm0.07$. With a bulk density of $3.80 \\pm 0.70$ g/cm$^3$, the\nplanet might be rocky with a substantial H$_2$ atmosphere or it might be a\n``water world\". With an equilibrium temperature of $\\sim$480 K, HD 35843 c is\namong the coolest $\\sim 5\\%$ of planets discovered by TESS. Combined with the\nhost star's relative brightness (V= 9.4), HD 35843 c is a promising target for\natmospheric characterization that will probe this sparse population of\ntemperate sub-Neptunes.\n",

    "title": "Soft Oscillons",
    "summary": "  We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with\nconventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly\nlarge sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by\ntheir size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core\nstructure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad\nclass of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence\nto a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically\nacts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation\nrate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are\nlonger lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial\nradius or more.\n",

    "title": "A Model of UV-Blue Absorbance in Bulk Liquid of Venusian Cloud Aerosols\n  Is Consistent with Efficient Organic Absorbers at High Concentrations",
    "summary": "  At visible wavelengths, Venus appears serene and pale-yellow, but since the\n1920s, observers have noted high-contrast features in the ultraviolet. These\nfeatures track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary\nwidely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s)-active between\nat least 280 and 500 nm-remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches\nall observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for\nlight scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm\nabsorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus's clouds. Assuming a\nuniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the\ncloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm\nbeing 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a\nhighly efficient absorber, most likely conjugated organics, at relatively high\nconcentration-e.g. about 25 g/L for porphyrin type pigments. Inorganic\nabsorbers, with molar absorption coefficients typically in the range of\n1,000-10,000 per M per cm, would either need to comprise a large portion of the\naerosols or are simply not light absorbent enough, even if present in pure\nform. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against\nVenus's reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii)\nrealistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size\ndistributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of\norganics in Venus's clouds.\n",

    "title": "The Telescope Calibration of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer",
    "summary": "  Fifty years after the very first sounding rocket measurement of cosmic X-ray\npolarization, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission has\neffectively opened a new window into the X-ray sky. Prior to launch of IXPE, an\nextensive calibration campaign was carried out to fully characterize the\nresponse of this new type of instrument. Specifically, the\npolarization-sensitive detectors were intensively calibrated in Italy, where\nthey were developed and built. The X-ray optics, which collect and focus X rays\nonto the detectors, were built and calibrated in the U.S. A key question was\nwhether the telescope (optics + detectors) calibrations could be synthesized\nfrom the individual component calibrations, avoiding time consuming and costly\nend-to-end calibrations for a flight program with a fixed schedule.\n  The data presented here are from a calibration of the flight spare telescope\nutilizing the flight spare detector and flight spare mirror assembly combined.\nThese data show that the presence of the mirror module does not affect the\npolarization response of the detectors (within the required calibration\naccuracy) and that the angular resolution of the telescopes could be accurately\ndetermined. Thus, the original extensive stand-alone ground calibration data of\nall the flight detectors and all the flight optic can be utilized in full to\nderive the flight telescopes calibrations.\n",

    "summary": "  The convectively driven, weakly magnetized regions of the solar photosphere\ndominate the Sun's surface at any given time, but the temporal variations of\nthese quiet regions of the photosphere throughout the solar cycle are still not\nwell known. To look for cycle-dependent changes in the convective properties of\nquiet Sun photosphere, we use high spatial and spectral resolution\nspectropolarimetric observations obtained by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT) and apply the Spectropolarimetric Inversions Based on Response Functions\n(SIR) code to infer physical conditions in the lower solar photosphere. Using a\nhomogeneous set of 49 datasets, all taken at disk center, we analyze the\ntemperature stratification and the line-of-sight velocities of the granules and\nintergranules over a period of 15 years. We use a k-means clustering technique\napplied to the spectral profiles to segment the granules and intergranules\nbased on both intensity and velocity. We also examine the profile bisectors of\nthese different structures and compare these to past analyses. Our results show\nfairly constant properties over this period with no clear dependence on the\nsolar cycle. We do, however, find a slight increase in the photospheric\ntemperature gradient during the declining phase of the solar cycle. Our\nfindings could have significant implications for understanding the coupling\nbetween the quiet Sun atmosphere and the global solar dynamo.\n",

    "summary": "  Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have recently found strong evidence for\nlow-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) in the nanohertz frequency regime. As\nGWs pass, they produce deviations in measured lengths and light-travel times.\nPTA experiments utilize the highly-consistent radio bursts from millisecond\npulsars, distributed throughout the local galaxy, to identify miniscule timing\ndeviations indicative of GWs. To distinguish GWs from noise, PTAs search for a\nparticular correlation pattern between different pulsars called Hellings &\nDowns correlations. The type of GW signal that has recently been identified is\na stochastic GW background (GWB), which is observed to have more power at lower\nGW frequencies. A GWB matching these observations has long been predicted from\nsuper-massive black-hole (SMBH) binaries. SMBHs are known to exist in the\ncenters of galaxies, which can then form binaries when two SMBHs are brought\ntogether following the merger of galaxies. No example of an SMBH binary has\nconfidently been identified to date, and tremendous uncertainties about their\nformation and evolution remain. Alternative sources of the GWB have also been\nproposed, based on models for new fundamental physics, particularly in the\nearly Universe. Improved sensitivity of PTAs will eventual lead to the\ncharacterization of GWB anisotropy and constraints on GWs from individual SMBH\nbinaries, either of which could definitively demonstrate the true origin of the\nGWB. If the source is SMBH binaries, a variety of electromagnetic counterparts\nare possible, allowing for multimessenger astrophysics with low-frequency GWs.\n",

    "title": "The JWST weather report from the nearest brown dwarfs II: Consistent\n  variability mechanisms over 7 months revealed by 1-14 $μ$m NIRSpec + MIRI\n  monitoring of WISE 1049AB",
    "summary": "  We present a new epoch of JWST spectroscopic variability monitoring of the\nbenchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs\nknown. Our 8-hour MIRI low resolution spectroscopy (LRS) and 7-hour NIRSpec\nprism observations extended variability measurements for any brown dwarfs\nbeyond 11 $\\mu$m for the first time, reaching up to 14 $\\mu$m. Combined with\nthe previous epoch in 2023, they set the longest JWST weather monitoring\nbaseline to date. We found that both WISE 1049AB show wavelength-dependent\nlight curve behaviours. Using a robust k-means clustering algorithm, we\nidentified several clusters of variability behaviours associated with three\ndistinct pressure levels. By comparing to a general circulation model (GCM), we\nidentified the possible mechanisms that drive the variability at these pressure\nlevels: Patchy clouds rotating in and out of view likely shaped the dramatic\nlight curves in the deepest layers between 1-2.5 $\\mu$m, whereas hot spots\narising from temperature / chemical variations of molecular species likely\ndominate the high-altitude levels between 2.5-3.6 $\\mu$m and 4.3-8.5 $\\mu$m.\nSmall-grain silicates potentially contributed to the variability of WISE 1049A\nat 8.5-11 $\\mu$m. While distinct atmospheric layers are governed by different\nmechanisms, we confirmed for the first time that each variability mechanism\nremains consistent within its layer over the long term. Future multi-period\nobservations will further test the stability of variability mechanisms on this\nbinary, and expanded JWST variability surveys across the L-T-Y sequence will\nallow us to trace and understand variability mechanisms across a wider\npopulation of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects.\n",

    "title": "Detecting gravitational signatures of dark matter with atom gradiometers",
    "summary": "  We study the purely gravitational signatures of dark matter from the\nultralight to the ultraheavy mass range in proposed long-baseline atom\ngradiometers. Due to their exceptional acceleration sensitivity, proposed\nspace-based experiments, such as MAGIS-space, AEDGE and AEDGE+, could detect a\ndark matter subcomponent which constitutes $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ of the local\ndark matter energy density and is populated by compact clumps of mass between\n$10^6$ kg and $10^{10}$ kg ($10^{-25}~M_\\odot\\lesssim M \\lesssim\n10^{-21}~M_\\odot$), in an otherwise unexplored region of dark matter model\nspace. Furthermore, because the gravitational observable depends on the\nrelative gravitational time delay measured by spatially separated atomic\nclouds, we find that atom gradiometers are parametrically more sensitive than\nlaser interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA, to fast-oscillating spacetime\nperturbations sourced by energy density and pressure fluctuations of ultralight\ndark matter. In optimistic scenarios, space-based experiments are projected to\nprobe a DM overdensity of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ times the local dark matter energy\ndensity for masses $m\\lesssim 10^{-17}$ eV. We therefore conclude that proposed\natom gradiometers may be poised to detect dark matter through purely\ngravitational interactions.\n",

We use a\nBayesian approach to estimate these values using two independent techniques:\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo sampling, and importance nested sampling. We consider\ntwo vertical density profiles for the thick disc. In the exponential model, the\nscale length of the thick disc is $h_R=2.14_{-0.17}^{+0.19}$ kpc, and its scale\nheight is $h_z=0.64_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ kpc. In the squared hyperbolic secant\nprofile $sech^2$, those values are correspondingly $h_R=2.10_{-0.17}^{+0.19}$\nkpc and $h_z=1.02_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$ kpc. The density distribution of the inner\nhalo can be described as a power law function with the exponent $n\n=-2.35_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ and flattening $q =0.57_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$. We also\nestimate the halo to disc concentration ratio as $\\gamma=0.19_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$\nfor the exponential disc and $\\gamma=0.32_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ for the $sech^2$\ndisc.\n",

    "summary": "  We use a one-dimensional line-by-line radiative-convective model to simulate\nhot, dense terrestrial-planet atmospheres. We find that strong shortwave\nabsorption by H2O and CO2 inhibits near-surface convection, reducing surface\ntemperatures by up to approximately 2000 K compared to fully convective\npredictions. Pure CO2 atmospheres are typically 1000 K cooler than pure H2O\natmospheres, with only a few percent of H2O needed to elevate surface\ntemperatures by hundreds of kelvin for a fixed incident stellar radiation. We\nalso show that minor greenhouse gases such as SO2 and NH3 have a limited\nwarming effect when H2O is abundant. Even at insolation values as high as\n12,500 W/m2 (about 37 times Earth's current solar flux), planets with mixed\nCO2-H2O envelopes have surface temperatures in the 1200 to 2000 K range,\nlimiting surface melting. Our results highlight the critical role of shortwave\nheating on magma ocean planets and the need for improved high-temperature\nspectroscopy beyond 20,000 cm-1.\n",

Such\napplications include astronomy and free-space optical communications, where\nlight propagates through the atmosphere, as well as medical microscopy and\nvision science, where light propagates through biological tissue. Recent works\nhave demonstrated common-path wavefront sensors for adaptive optics using the\nphotonic lantern, a slowly varying waveguide that can efficiently couple\nmulti-moded light into single-mode fibers. We use the SCExAO astrophotonics\nplatform at the 8-m Subaru Telescope to show that spectral dispersion of\nlantern outputs can improve correction fidelity, culminating with an on-sky\ndemonstration of real-time wavefront control. To our best knowledge, this is\nthe first such result for either a spectrally dispersed or a photonic lantern\nwavefront sensor. Combined with the benefits offered by lanterns in precision\nspectroscopy, our results suggest the future possibility of a unified wavefront\nsensing spectrograph using compact photonic devices.\n",

    "title": "JFlow: Model-Independent Spherical Jeans Analysis using Equivariant\n  Continuous Normalizing Flows",
    "summary": "  The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to\nunderstand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic\ninformation of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and\nline-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging.\nConventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with\nseveral parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the\nspherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine\nlearning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent\nway as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that\nspherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions\ncan be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our\nmethod to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter\nmass densities given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo\nstructures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.\n",

    "summary": "  Significant numbers of free-floating planetary-mass objects have been\ndiscovered in nearby star-forming regions by the James Webb Space Telescope,\nincluding a substantial number (42) of Jupiter Mass Binary Objects ('JuMBOs')\nin the Orion Nebula Cluster. The JuMBOs have much wider separations than other\npopulations of substellar binaries, and their existence challenges conventional\ntheories of substellar and planetary-mass object formation. Whilst several\ntheories have been proposed to explain their formation, there has yet to be a\nstudy that determines whether they could survive the dynamical encounters\nprevalent within a dense star-forming region. We place a population of\nplanet-planet binaries in N-body simulations of dense star-forming regions and\ncalculate their binary fraction over time. We find that between 50-90 per cent\nof planet-planet binaries are destroyed on timescales of a few Myr, which\nimplies that many more must form if we are to observe them in their current\nnumbers. Furthermore, if the ONC was much more dense at formation, the initial\nseparation distribution of the JuMBOs must have been even wider (and less\nsimilar to other substellar binaries) than the observed distribution.\n",

    "title": "Luminosity Function of collapsar Gamma-Ray Bursts:the Progenitor of Long\n  Gamma-Ray Bursts Is Not Singular",
    "summary": "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful probes of the high-redshift universe.\nHowever, the proportion of collapsar GRBs among long GRBs and their event rate\nrelative to the star formation rate (SFR) remain contentious issues. We assume\nthat long GRBs with $z\\geq 2$ are all collapsar GRBs and construct the\nluminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite\nspanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law\nform and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and\ndensity evolution. Our results are as follows: 1) The no-evolution model can be\nruled out. 2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the\nobservations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution\nindex $\\delta = 1.54^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$) or density ($\\delta =\n2.09^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$) is required. This excludes the possibility that the\nevolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from non-collapsar\nGRBs. 3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar\nGRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq 1 \\, \\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\nis 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq\n1 \\, \\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$. The density evolution model\npredicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq 1 \\,\n\\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of\nthe observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long\nGRBs are not collapsar GRBs.\n",

Our NIRSpec data confirms that Phaethon's surface is\ndehydrated, showing no evidence of hydrated minerals in the 3-$\\mu$m region. We\nestimate an upper limit on the hydrogen content in phyllosilicates of 0.06 wt%.\nComparisons with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites suggest that\nPhaethon's surface composition is best matched by thermally metamorphosed\nsamples of the CM chondrite Murchison (heated to 1000$^{\\circ}$C), rather than\nCY meteorites as previous work suggested. We find no evidence of ongoing\nsurface evolution due to recent perihelion passages. A comparison of the\nmid-infrared spectra of Phaethon and Bennu shows distinct spectral differences\nthat are consistent with their different thermal histories. Our findings\nfurther refine our understanding of Phaethon's current surface composition and\nevolution and provide additional insights for the upcoming DESTINY+ mission.\n",

    "title": "Spectral-timing analysis of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations\n  and constraints on the mass of the neutron star in $4U 1636-536$ using\n  AstroSat observations",
    "summary": "  Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are believed to originate\nfrom the orbital timescales of the inner accretion flow, reflecting the\ndynamics of the innermost disk regions under strong gravitational forces.\nDespite numerous radiative and geometric models proposed so far, a\ncomprehensive explanation of the observed properties of these variability\ncomponents remains elusive. This study systematically examines kHz QPOs, their\nvariability, and their connection to spectral properties in $4U 1636-536$ using\nAstroSat data. Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft\nstates in the hardness-intensity diagram. Broad spectral analysis (0.7-25 keV)\nusing SXT and LAXPC data indicates a spectrum shaped by reflection from a\nthermal corona, with contributions from boundary layer emission and a soft disk\ncomponent. We find significant changes in optical depth, blackbody temperature,\nand inner disk temperature that likely drive state transitions. Power density\nspectra reveal three variability types: a low frequency QPO (LFQPOs) (~30 Hz),\nand two simultaneous kHz QPOs. The LFQPOs and the upper kHz QPOs appear more\nprominently in soft spectral states. The presence of LFQPOs and twin kHz QPOs\nin soft spectral states enable us to estimate the neutron star mass at (2.37\n$\\pm$ 0.02) $M_\\odot$ using the relativistic precession model (RPM).\nAdditionally, time-lag and root mean square (rms) analysis provide insights\ninto the size of the corona and the radiative origin of these variability\ncomponents.\n",

Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing\nstep, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g.\nBayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to\nbuild a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known\nglitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on\nthe glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference\nanalysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch\nidentification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show\nthat this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly\nimproving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.\n",

    "summary": "  Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich\ninformation from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys,\nand ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In\nthis work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD)\ndetection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based\nsimulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric\nfor OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques,\ndemonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous\ntime flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that\ncombine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with\nnormalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as\nquantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples\nbut also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we\nverified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while\nmitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our\nproof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings,\nour framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown\nsystematics in the cosmology datasets.\n",

    "title": "Turning dispersion into signal: density-split analyses of pairwise\n  velocities",
    "summary": "  Pairwise velocities of the large-scale structure encode valuable information\nabout the growth of structure. They can be observed indirectly through\nredshift-space distortions and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Whether it\nis Gaussian or non-Gaussian, pairwise velocity has a broad distribution, but\nthe cosmologically useful information lies primarily in the mean - the\nstreaming velocities; the dispersion around the mean is often treated as a\nnuisance and marginalized over. This conventional approach reduces the\nconstraining power of our observations. Here, we show that this does not have\nto be the case, provided the physics behind the dispersion is understood. We\ndemonstrate that by splitting the halo/galaxy samples according to their\ndensity environments and measuring the streaming velocities separately, the\ntotal signal-to-noise is several times greater than in conventional global\nmeasurements of the pairwise velocity distribution (PVD). This improvement\narises because the global PVD is a composite of a series of near-Gaussian\ndistributions with different means and dispersions, each determined by its\nlocal density environment. Around underdense and overdense regions, the mean\nstreaming velocities are positive and negative, respectively. By splitting the\ndata, we avoid cancellation between these opposing velocities, effectively\nturning what would be considered dispersion in the global PVD into a signal.\nOur findings indicate substantial potential for improving the analysis of PVD\nobservations using the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and redshift-space\ndistortions.\n",

    "summary": "  The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for\nunbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time\ndelays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass\nmodel to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations,\npositional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take\naccount of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the\ninterpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife\nmethod as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically\nfocusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple\nimages of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple\nimages of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the\nremoved source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed\npositions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in\nsimulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass\nmodeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of\nusing the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical\nquantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\n",

    "title": "Unified QMF equation of state for neutron star matter: Static and\n  dynamic properties",
    "summary": "  We construct a set of unified equations of state based on the quark mean\nfield (QMF) model, calibrated to different values of nuclear symmetry energy\nslope at the saturation density ($L_0$), with the aim of exploring both the\nstatic properties and dynamical behavior of neutron stars (NSs), and building a\ncoherent picture of their internal structure. We assess the performance of\nthese QMF models in describing the mass-radius relation, the cooling evolution\nof isolated NSs and X-ray transients, and the instabilities (e.g., the r-mode).\nIn comparison to relativistic mean field (RMF) models formulated at the\nhadronic level, the QMF model predicts heavier nuclear clusters and larger\nWigner-Seitz cell sizes in the NS crust, while the density of the free neutron\ngas remains largely similar between the two approaches. For the cooling of\nisolated NSs, the thermal evolution is found to be insensitive to both the\nmany-body model and the symmetry energy slope in the absence of the direct Urca\n(dUrca) process. However, when rapid cooling via the dUrca process is allowed,\nin the case of large $L_0$ values (e.g., $L_0 \\gtrsim 80$ MeV) in our study,\nthe QMF model predicts a longer thermal relaxation time. Both the QMF and RMF\nmodels can reproduce cooling curves consistent with observations of X-ray\ntransients (e.g., KS 1731--260) during their crustal cooling phase, although\nstellar parameters show slight variations depending on the model and symmetry\nenergy slope. Within our unified framework, a larger $L_0$ value generally\nresults in a wider instability window, while increasing the stellar mass tends\nto suppress the instability window. We also provide simple power-law\nparameterizations that quantify the dependence of bulk and shear viscosities on\nthe symmetry energy slope for nuclear matter at saturation density.\n",

    "summary": "  We investigate the impact of spacetime non-commutativity on the tidal\ndeformability of compact objects and explore the feasibility of detecting\nnon-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We\nconsidered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge\ntheory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While\nseveral types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing\nspacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study\nshowed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their\nsurface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their\ntidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness\nlimit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute\nthe NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several\ndifferent models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing\nthe results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness\nregimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be\namplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction\ndominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the\nblack-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars\nare not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while\nrelying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.\n",

    "title": "Modeling Metric Gyrosynchrotron Radio Emission From the Quiet Solar\n  Corona",
    "summary": "  The radio emission of the quiet Sun in the metric and decametric bands has\nnot been well studied historically due to limitations of existing instruments.\nIt is nominally dominated by thermal brehmsstrahlung of the solar corona, but\nmay also include significant gyrosynchrotron emission, usually assumed to be\nweak under quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the expected\ngyrosynchrotron contribution to solar radio emission in the lowest radio\nfrequencies observable by ground instruments, for different regions of the low\nand middle corona. We approximate the coronal conditions by a synoptic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The thermal emission is estimated from a\nforward model based on the simulated corona. We calculate the expected\ngyrosynchrotron emission with the Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes framework by\nFleishman & Kuznetsov (2010). The model emissions of different coronal regions\nare compared with quiet-time observations between 20-90 MHz by the LOw\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope. The contribution of gyrosynchrotron\nradiation to low frequency solar radio emission may shed light on effects such\nas the hitherto unexplained brightness variation observed in decametric coronal\nhole emission, and help constrain measurements of the coronal magnetic fields.\nIt can also improve our understanding of electron populations in the middle\ncorona and their relation to the formation of the solar wind.\n",

    "title": "Thermal evolution model from cometary nuclei to asteroids considering\n  contraction associated with ice sublimation",
    "summary": "  Comet--asteroid transition (CAT) objects are small solar system bodies in the\nprocess of evolving from cometary nuclei into asteroids, as they gradually lose\nvolatile substances due to solar heating. The volatile material is mainly water\nice, and the time required for its complete depletion is called the desiccation\ntime. Estimating the desiccation time is important for examining the formation\nand evolution of small solar system bodies. Here, we propose a new theoretical\nmodel for evaluating the desiccation time as a function of orbital elements,\nconsidering the contraction of the entire cometary nucleus due to ice\nsublimation. First, we performed numerical calculations of the thermal\nevolution of a cometary nucleus in an eccentric orbit, considering the seasonal\nvariation in the solar heating rate. Next, we derived the desiccation time\nanalytically as a function of orbital elements based on a steady-state model\nconsidering the solar heating rate averaged over the seasons. We compared the\nnumerical solutions for the desiccation time with the analytical solutions and\nclarified the conditions under which the analytical model can be applied.\nAdditionally, based on the analytical model, we derived formulae for estimating\nthe emission rates of water vapor and dust on the surface of the cometary\nnucleus, the maximum size of the emitted dust, and the dust emission velocity,\nby assuming the amount of ice remaining inside the nucleus. Using these\nanalytical solutions, we considered the internal structure and evolution\nprocess of typical CAT objects. Our analytical model was generally consistent\nwith that of the results of earlier observations of these objects. Our model\nprovides a theoretical guideline for discussing the evolution of cometary\nnuclei and the possibility of retaining internal ice in asteroids.\n",

    "title": "Multiple generation star formation in Cepheus Flare",
    "summary": "  We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia\nDR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the\nnumber identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria,\nASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15\nto 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming\nregion, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes\nat approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas\nmapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which\nmay have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with\nearlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the\nlarger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely\ninfluenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar\npopulations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the\nfeedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.\n",

Particular emphasis is given to\nthe asymmetric-matter equation of state required for modeling neutron stars,\nneutron-star mergers, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Recent analyses based on\ncombining information obtained from nuclear theory, heavy-ion collisions and\nastrophysical observations confine the obtained radii of the canonical\n1.4-solar-mass neutron star to values between 12 km and 13 km.

    "title": "Constraints on the state of the IGM at $z\\sim 8-10$ using redshifted\n  21-cm observations with LOFAR",
    "summary": "  The power spectra of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of\nReionization (EoR) contain information about the ionization and thermal states\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM), and depend on the properties of the EoR\nsources. Recently, Mertens et al 2025 has analysed 10 nights of LOFAR high-band\ndata and estimated upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts 8.3,\n9.1 and 10.1. Here we use these upper limit results to constrain the properties\nof the IGM at those redshifts. We focus on the properties of the ionized and\nheated regions where the temperature is larger than that of the CMB. We model\nthe 21-cm power spectrum with the code GRIZZLY, and use a Bayesian inference\nframework to explore the source parameters for uniform priors on their ranges.\nThe framework also provides information about the IGM properties in the form of\nderived parameters. In a model which includes a radio background in excess of\nthe CMB, the 95 (68) per cent credible intervals of disfavoured models at\nredshift 9.1 for the chosen priors correspond to IGM states with averaged\nionization and heated fraction below 0.46 ($\\lesssim 0.05$), an average gas\ntemperature below 44 K (4 K), and a characteristic size of the heated region\n$\\lesssim 14 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$ ($\\lesssim 3 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$). The\n68 per cent credible interval suggests an excess radio background which is more\nthan 100 per cent of the CMB at 1.42 GHz, while the 95 per cent credible\ninterval of the radio background efficiency parameter spans the entire prior\nrange. The behaviour of the credible intervals is similar at all redshifts. The\nmodels disfavoured by the LOFAR upper limits are extreme ones, as they are\nmainly driven by rare and large ionized or heated regions.\n",

    "title": "Dust density enhancements and the direct formation of planetary cores in\n  gravitationally unstable discs",
    "summary": "  Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can\naccumulate to form planetary cores. There are a number of barriers to the\ncollisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift,\nor metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to\ncause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs,\npotentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from\nthe disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that\nexplore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is\nmassive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density\nwaves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and\nfind that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an\norder of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid\nparticles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to\nsufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo\ndirect gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically\nbetween $1$ and $10$ M$_\\oplus$. Thus, the concentration of dust in a\nself-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and\ndirectly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.\n",

    "title": "Attitude Control of Spacecraft for Autonomous Attenuation of Unknown\n  Periodic Disturbance Torque",
    "summary": "  Recently, deep space exploration, especially focusing on halo orbits, the\nperiodic orbits of the Moon, has been widely studied. The spacecraft in halo\norbits performs periodic orbital motion, which affects the attitude motion by\nperiodic disturbances. The conventional attitude control method, PD control, is\nwidely used, but its application to periodic disturbance attenuation is\ninefficient. To address these challenges, this study proposes a predictive\nRepetitive Control (RC) approach that addresses periodic disturbances,\nparticularly GG torque, by exploiting the periodic nature of the system\ndynamics. The proposed method is also applied to the case of using a Reaction\nWheel (RW) as an attitude control actuator. Despite the inherent challenges\nposed by RW limitations, including saturation torque and transmission delay,\nour predictive RC approach effectively mitigates these effects. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method in\nmaintaining attitude control for spacecraft traversing halo orbits near the\nEarth-Moon $L_2$ point, validating its potential for future deep space\nexploration missions.\n",

    "title": "Denoising weak lensing mass maps with diffusion model: systematic\n  comparison with generative adversarial network",
    "summary": "  (abridged) Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is the unique and powerful probe\ninto the large-scale structures of the Universe. Removing the shape noise from\nthe observed WL field, i.e., denoising, enhances the potential of WL by\naccessing information at small scales where the shape noise dominates without\ndenoising. We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative\nadversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance\nof denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations,\nwhich serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000\nmaps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models\ncan fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we\nmeasure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point\nprobability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering\ntransform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all\nstatistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales within\nroughly $0.3 \\sigma$ level at the scales accessible from current and future WL\nsurveys. We also conduct the stress tests on the trained model; denoising the\nmaps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the\ndata used in training. The performance degrades at small scales, but the\nstatistics can still be recovered at large scales. Though the training of DM is\nmore computationally demanding compared with GAN, there are several advantages:\nnumerically stable training, higher performance in the reconstruction of\ncosmological statistics, and sampling multiple realisations once the model is\ntrained. It has been known that DM can generate higher-quality images in\nreal-world problems than GAN, the superiority has been confirmed as well in the\nWL denoising problem.\n",

Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of\ndark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation\nproduced by these decays.

    "summary": "  The prestellar core Barnard 68 (B68) is a prototypical source to study the\ninitial conditions and chemical processes of star formation. A previous\nnumerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main\nbody of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping\nobservations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were\nmade with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and\nchannel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected.\nThe velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a\nsolid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the\nbullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the\nvelocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet\nis most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical\nnon-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the\nradial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated\nintensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\\prime\\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from\nthe core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger\nthan 60$^{\\prime\\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is\nenhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock\nwaves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core. In\nconclusion, based on the kinematical and chemical analysis, our observational\nresults support the previously proposed core-core collision scenario in B68.\n",

    "title": "Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to\n  Neutrino-cooled Flows",
    "summary": "  When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in\na tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a\nmassive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas\nforms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and\ntemperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be\nconverted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional,\ngeneral-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a\nnon-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended\naccretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star.\nThe impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by\napproximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an\nadiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low\naccretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak\nmagnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic\nfield mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the\natmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the\naccretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these\nresults with more general initial conditions and describing the main features\nof the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of\nhypercritically accreting NSs.\n",

    "summary": "  In this letter, we investigate cosmology within the framework of modified\n$f(Q, L_m)$ gravity using the non-linear model $f(Q, L_m) = -Q + \\alpha L_m^n +\n\\beta$, where $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $n$ are free parameters. The modified\nFriedmann equations are derived for a matter-dominated universe, and an\nanalytical solution is obtained. Using Hubble, Pantheon+, and joint datasets,\nwe constrain the model parameters and examine their implications. The results\nindicate that the model accommodates varying $H_0$ values, contributing to the\nHubble tension, while $n \\neq 1$ suggests deviations from general relativity\n(GR). The deceleration parameter confirms a transition to acceleration at $z_t\n\\approx 0.6 - 0.8$, with present values supporting cosmic acceleration. This\nmodel offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology.\n",

    "summary": "  The first simultaneous observations of the Fe XVIII 974.86 {\\AA} and Fe XX\n721.56 {\\AA} forbidden lines from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal\nEnvironment (SPICE) spectrograph on Solar Orbiter are presented. The lines were\nobserved from the post-flare loops of an M2.5 class solar flare that peaked at\n23:49 UT on 2024 March 23. The Fe XX/Fe XVIII ratio is used to derive a\ntemperature space-time map for the flaring period, with values ranging from 8\nto 20 MK. The map reveals repeated episodes of heating at the SPICE slit\nlocation over a 30 min period. For one location with the brightest emission,\nthe plasma cooled from 10 MK to 8 MK in 5 min which is longer than the expected\nconductive cooling time of 170 s, suggesting continued background heating\nduring the cooling period. Doppler shifts of between 0 and +10 km/s were\nobtained with precisions of 1-4 km/s, but the accuracies are lower due to\nuncertainties over the absolute wavelength calibration hence we can not\nconclude there are plasma flows in the flare loops. The widths of the two lines\nwere found to be close to the instrumental widths with no evidence of\nnon-thermal broadening, although this result is limited by the instrument\nresolution. The Fe XVIII and Fe XX lines have high signal-to-noise with only a\n5 s exposure time, demonstrating that the lines will be valuable for\nhigh-cadence flare studies with SPICE.\n",

    "title": "Bayesian Inference of Core Properties of Hybrid Stars from Future\n  High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii",
    "summary": "  Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observations of neutron\nstars (NSs) are expected to measure NS radii to better than $\\sigma=0.1$ km\naccuracy, providing unprecedented opportunities to extract novel information\nabout the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores.\nWithin a Bayesian framework using a meta-model for NS EOS encapsulating a\nfirst-order hadron-quark phase transition and satisfying all known constraints\nfrom both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we investigate how NS radius data\nwith higher precision may better inform us about (1) the NS crust-core\ntransition density $\\rho_{cc}$, (2) the hadron-quark transition density\n$\\rho_t$, quark matter fraction $F_{\\rm{QM}}$ and its radius $R_{\\rm{QM}}$, and\n(3) high-density NS EOS parameters. Using fiducial NS radius data with mocked\nprecisions varying from $\\sigma=1.0$ km to 0.1 km, we found (a) the most\nprobable crust-core transition density $\\rho_{cc}$ and its 68\\% confidence\nboundaries are essentially unaffected by $\\sigma$ especially for massive NSs;\n(b) our answers to the questions (2) and (3) listed above depend sensitively on\nthe prior range of hadron-quark transition density $\\rho_t$ assumed. Using its\nfiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\\rho_t$) has a major\npeak around $(1.7-2.0)\\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing\nall existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\\rho_0$\nconsistent with the indication about $\\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan\nExperiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\\rho_t$ to\n$(3.0-6.0)\\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\\sigma$ can constrain more\nstringently the posterior PDF($\\rho_t$), $F_{\\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\\rm{QM}}$ and\nseveral high-density hadronic EOS parameters.\n",

    "title": "Reduced solar quadrupole moment compensates for lack of asteroids in\n  long-term solar system integrations",
    "summary": "  State-of-the-art long-term solar system integrations include several second\norder effects such as the Sun's quadrupole moment J2 and a contribution from\nasteroids (plus the Moon and general relativity). We recently showed that\nincluding 10 asteroids and a reduced J2 in our astronomical solutions provides\nthe best match with geologic data to -58 Myr. However, the rationale for the\nreduced J2 remained ambiguous and may suggest that parameters for long-term\nintegrations compatible with geologic observations are not fully compatible\nwith our knowledge of the current solar system (specifically J2). Here we show\nthat a reduced J2 compensates for a diminished asteroid population in long-term\nsolar system integrations, which may appear surprising. We present an analysis\nand offer a mechanism for the long-term compensating effects of J2 and asteroid\nmass in the solar system (not planetary systems in general). Our analysis\nsuggests that \"differential effects\" on specific secular frequencies involved\nin resonant terms (i.e., (g4-g3) and (s4-s3)), are critical in the long term,\nrather than short-term effects on the orbital elements of individual planetary\norbits across the board. Also, our results indicate that if long-term\nintergrations including the full asteroid population were computationally\nfeasible, a J2 value (within errors) compatible with our current knowledge of\nthe solar system could be used. Attempts to improve the long-term accuracy of\nastronomical solutions by, e.g., tinkering with initial conditions using\ncurrent/future astronomical observations are futile unless asteroid\ndeficiencies in the solar system model are addressed.\n",

    "title": "Absence of TeV halos around millisecond pulsars",
    "summary": "  TeV halos are extended very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission\naround middle-aged pulsars. So far they have only been found around isolated\npulsars, but it has been suggested that they may also be powered by millisecond\npulsars (MSPs). We searched for VHE gamma-ray emission from MSPs reported by\nradio and GeV gamma-ray observatories in 2565 days of data from the High\nAltitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. We found no significant emission\nfrom individual pulsars. By combining the likelihood profiles of all MSPs\naccessible to HAWC, our analysis suggests that the excess emission around the\nMSP population is consistent with a background. Our result suggests that MSPs\nare not as efficient as isolated pulsars in producing TeV halos. This finding\nhas strong implications on the physics interpretation of the Galactic Center\nGeV excess and high-latitude Galactic diffuse emission.\n",

    "title": "Variable Polarization of WR~31a: Binary Companion or Co-Rotating\n  Interaction Region?",
    "summary": "  WR 31a (Hen 3-519) is likely a post-luminous blue variable (LBV) star that is\nevolving to become a classical Wolf-Rayet star. Multicolor (UBVR)\nphotopolarimetric observations of WR 31a were obtained over nine nights in\nearly 2007. The linear polarization data of WR 31a trace a \"loop\" structure in\na Stokes Q-U diagram, which is similar in all four passbands. After mean\nsubtraction, the four loops align to form a single overall pattern. Such loops\ncan be expected to arise from binary systems. We test the binary hypothesis\nwith two models. The data are fit for a strictly circular orbit to derive an\norbital period of 16.7 d, requiring a high inclination perspective of $i\\sim\n80^\\circ$. We also consider an elliptical orbit under simplifying assumptions,\nyielding a match for $i\\sim 75^\\circ$ with eccentricity $e\\sim 0.5$ and a\nlonger orbital period of about 70 d. The prevalence of binarity among massive\nstars is well-known; the prospect of detecting a binary companion during the\npost-LBV stage of WR 31a would add to an emerging narrative of diverse\ninteractions between massive multiple components as a function of evolutionary\nstage. However, if the loop originates because of a co-rotating interaction\nregion (CIR), then the rotation period could be 8.5 d or 17 d. This would give\nan estimated equatorial rotation speed of 95 or 190 km/s. Either of these is a\nsignificant fraction of the estimated critical speed of rotational break-up at\n320 km/s (for an Eddington factor of $\\Gamma=0$).\n",

    "title": "Extended TeV Halos May Commonly Exist around Middle-Aged Pulsars",
    "summary": "  Extended gamma-ray emission around isolated pulsars at TeV energies, also\nknown as TeV halos, have been found around a handful of middle-aged pulsars.\nThe halos are significantly more extended than their pulsar wind nebulae but\nmuch smaller than the particle diffusion length in the interstellar medium. The\norigin of TeV halos is unknown. Interpretations invoke either local effects\nrelated to the environment of a pulsar or generic particle transport behaviors.\nThe latter scenario predicts that TeV halos would be a universal phenomena for\nall pulsars. We searched for extended gamma-ray emission around 36 isolated\nmiddle-aged pulsars identified by radio and gamma-ray facilities using 2321\ndays of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. Through\na stacking analysis comparing TeV flux models against a background-only\nhypothesis, we identified TeV halo-like emission at a significance level of\n$5.10\\,\\sigma$. Our results imply that extended TeV gamma-ray halos may\ncommonly exist around middle-aged pulsars. This reveals a previously unknown\nfeature about pulsars and opens a new window to identify the pulsar population\nthat is invisible to radio, x-ray, and GeV gamma-ray observations due to\nmagnetospheric configurations.\n",

    "title": "Emergence of wind ripples controlled by mechanics of grain-bed impacts",
    "summary": "  Periodic sediment patterns have been observed on Earth in riverbeds and sand\nand snow deserts, but also in other planetary environments. One of the most\nubiquitous patterns, familiar wind or 'impact' ripples, adorns sand beaches and\narid regions on Earth. The observation of aeolian impact ripples on Mars the\nsame size as their terrestrial counterparts despite a thinner atmosphere raises\nquestions about their formation. Here we show in a numerical simulation that\nthe emergent wavelength of impact ripples is controlled by the mechanics of\ngrain-bed impacts and not the characteristic trajectories of grains above the\nbed. We find that the distribution of grain trajectories in transport is\nessentially scale-free, invoking the proximity of a critical point and\nprecluding a transport-related length scale that selects ripple wavelengths. By\ncontrast, when a grain strikes the bed, the process leading to grain ejections\nintroduces a collective granular length scale that determines the scale of the\nripples. We propose a theoretical model that predicts a relatively constant\nripple size for most planetary conditions. In addition, our model predicts that\nfor high-density atmospheres, such as on Venus, or for sufficiently large sand\ngrains on Earth, impact ripples propagate upwind. Although wind-tunnel and\nfield experiments are needed to confirm the existence of such 'antiripples', we\nsuggest that our quantitative model of wind-blown sediment transport may be\nused to deduce geological and environmental conditions on other planets from\nthe sizes and propagation speeds of impact ripples.\n",

    "title": "New Active Galactic Nuclei Detected by the ART-XC and eROSITA Telescopes\n  during the First Five SRG All-Sky X-ray Surveys. Part 2",
    "summary": "  We present the results of our identification of 11 X-ray sources detected on\nthe half of the sky $0^\\circ<l<180^\\circ$ in the 4-12 keV energy band on the\ncombined map of the first five all-sky surveys with the Mikhail Pavlinsky\nART-XC telescope onboard the SRG observatory. All these sources were also\ndetected by the SRG/eROSITA telescope in the 0.2-8 keV energy band, whose data\nhave allowed us to improve their positions and to investigate their X-ray\nspectra. Five of them have been detected in X-rays for the first time, while\nthe remaining ones have already been known previously, but their nature has\nremained unknown. We have taken optical spectra for nine sources with the 1.6-m\nAZT-33IK telescope at the Sayan Observatory (the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial\nPhysics, the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences); for two more\nobjects we have analyzed the archival spectra from SDSS and the 6dF survey. The\nobjects are classified as Seyfert galaxies (seven Sy1, three Sy1.9, and one\nSy2) at redshifts $z$=0.029-0.258. Our analysis of the X-ray spectra has\nrevealed a noticeable intrinsic absorption ($N_{\\rm H} \\sim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$)\nin two of the four Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy1.9-2). The spectrum of one more of\nthem (SRGA J000132.9+240237) cannot be described within the model of an\nabsorbed Comptonization continuum, which may point to a strong absorption and a\nsignificant contribution of the reflected radiation. However, the available SRG\nall-sky survey data are not enough to obtain reliable constraints on the\nabsorption column density in this object, which is also interesting in that it\nis radio loud. Longer X-ray observations are required to refine the physical\nproperties of this active galactic nucleus.\n",

    "summary": "  Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and\ncomputationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The\nPython-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR,\nincluding the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages\ncurvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios.\nHistorically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To\naddress this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that\nenables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory\nCharm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the\nstructured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its\ncorrectness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP\nversion on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in\ncylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to\n$\\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong\nscaling, achieving an $\\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared\nto the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This\nscalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork\nfor future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme\nparameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates\nwith other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the\ngeneral relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future\ncoupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.\n",

    "summary": "  Metallicity ($Z$) estimates based on ultraviolet (UV) emission lines from the\nnarrow-line regions (NLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been found to\ndiffer from those derived from optical lines. However, the origin of this\ndiscrepancy ($ZR$) remains poorly understood. To investigate the source of\n$ZR$, we compiled from the literature the fluxes of narrow near-UV ($1000 <\n\\lambda(\\angstrom) < 2000)$ and optical ($3000 < \\lambda(\\angstrom) < 7000)$\nemission line measurements for a sample of 11 AGNs (9 at $z<0.4$ and 2 at\n$z\\sim2.4$). Metallicity values for our sample were derived using a\nsemi-empirical calibration based on the\n$C43$=log[(\\ion{C{iv}$\\lambda$1549+\\ion{C{iii}]$\\lambda$1909)/\\ion{He}{ii}$\\lambda$1640]\nemission-line ratio and compared with those obtained via direct measurement of\nthe electron temperature ($T_{\\rm e}$-method) and via calibrations based on\noptical emission-lines. The source of the discrepancy was investigated in terms\nof the ionization parameter ($U$), electron density ($N_{\\rm e}$), and carbon\nabundance (C/H). We found a weak correlation between $ZR$, $U$ and $N_{\\rm e}$.\nHowever, a moderate correlation was observed between $ZR$ and direct estimates\nof C/H, suggesting that the previously assumed (C/O)-$Z$ relations in\nphotoionization models used to derive UV carbon-line calibrations may not be\nvalid for AGNs. By combining a large set of abundance estimates for local\nstar-forming regions with those of our AGN sample, we derived a new (C/O)-$Z$\nrelation. Comparisons between the results of photoionization models that assume\nthis new abundance relation and the UV observational data of our sample produce\n$Z$ values derived from the $C43$ index that are consistent with those obtained\nusing the $T_{\\rm e}$-method.\n",

Accurate estimation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is\ncrucial for shear measurement, but the wavelength dependence of the PSF\nintroduces chromatic biases that can systematically impact shear inference. We\nfocus on biases arising from spectral energy distribution (SED) differences\nbetween stars, used for PSF modeling, and galaxies, used for shear measurement.\nWe investigate these effects in $\\textit{Roman's}$ four design reference\nmission WL bands (Y106, J129, H158, F184) and wide filter (W146). Using\n$\\textit{Roman}$-like image simulations, we quantify the induced shear biases\nand compare them to requirements on those biases. Multiplicative biases over\nall galaxies hover around $\\sim$0.2% in the WL bands and 2% in the wide filter,\nexceeding the mission requirement of $|m| < 0.032\\%$ and relaxed requirement of\n$|m| < 0.1\\%$. In individual redshift bins, biases can reach\n0.4$\\unicode{x2013}$0.9% for the WL bands and 3$\\unicode{x2013}$6% for the wide\nfilter. Additive biases remain acceptable in the WL bands but exceed systematic\nlimits in the wide filter. We develop and test PSF-level corrections, showing\nthat a first-order correction reduces biases within survey requirements for the\nWL bands; however, higher-order terms are necessary for the wide filter. Our\nresults highlight the necessity of chromatic corrections for precision WL with\n$\\textit{Roman}$ and provide a framework for mitigating these biases. Finally,\nwe compare analytical color-based corrections to self-organizing maps (SOMs)\nand find that both methods effectively reduce biases.\n",

    "summary": "  Free-floating planets comprise one of the most enigmatic populations of\nexoplanets in the Galaxy. Though ground-based observations point to a large\nabundance of these worlds, little is known about their origins and\ndemographics. In the coming years, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's\nGalactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to detect several hundred\nfree-floating planets, providing the first opportunity to characterize these\nworlds at the population level. We present a first study of Roman's prospects\nfor reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through\npopulation-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true\nunderlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will\nbe able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of\nmagnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth. When\napplied to Roman's observations, the methodology we present herein will be\ncapable of discriminating between different hypothesized mass distributions at\nhigh statistical significance, opening a new window into the origins of these\nrogue worlds.\n",

    "summary": "  The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the\ngeneral theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic\nacceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative\ntheories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a\nfrequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than\naccessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band\nobservation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational\nwave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based\ndetectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including\nLISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale\nassociated with effective theory of gravity with a precision of approximately\n$8.6\\%$ by combining only $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ high SNR multi-band gravitational\nwave events. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more\nevents as $\\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an\nunexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into\nthe phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave\ndetector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of\nfundamental physics.\n",

    "summary": "  AT 2019aalc is a peculiar sequence of highly variable emission events\nobserved towards the nucleus of the broad-line AGN SDSS J152416.66+045119.0.\nThe system exhibited two distinct UV/optical flares (the first detected in\n2019, the second one in 2023). Spectra obtained following the detection of the\nsecond flare revealed prominent Bowen fluorescence and high-ionization coronal\nemission lines, which were much weaker, if at all detectable, in a spectrum\ntaken following the first flare. We present and analyze a large set of\nmulti-wavelength, multi-epoch data for this source, with particular emphasis on\noptical spectroscopic monitoring conducted with the Las Cumbres Observatory\nnetwork. During the relatively slow dimming that followed the second optical\nflare, the UV/optical light-curve shows a sequence of minor rebrightening\nevents, while the Bowen fluorescence and the coronal lines vary (roughly) in\ntandem with these \"bumps\" in the broad-band light-curve. Most of the observed\nbehavior of AT 2019aalc links it to the growing class of Bowen fluorescence\nflares (BFFs) while setting it apart from canonical tidal disruption events.\nHowever, AT 2019aalc has some outstanding peculiarities, including two short\nflares seen in its soft X-ray light-curve during the dimming phase of the\nsecond optical flare, and which do not seem to be linked to the emission line\nvariations. We discuss the optical and X-ray properties of the source and\npossible scenarios of the origin of the flare, in particular radiation pressure\ninstabilities in the (pre-existing) AGN accretion disk.\n",

    "summary": "  The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars\nwithin the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our\nunderstanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further\nexacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\\rm Q}\\lesssim 10^6$\nyears, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed\nin the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based\non the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable\nobscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our\nsightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime\nmeasurements for six quasars at $z \\sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular\nemission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very\nLarge Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended\nLy$\\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small\nproximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between\nthe SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the\nindependent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption\nsystem prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which\nthus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our\nresults provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode\nhas only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.\n",

    "title": "Detailed Simulations of Massive Hierarchical Triple Star Systems -\n  Exploring the impact of the stellar physics on the evolutionary pathways of\n  massive hierarchical triple systems",
    "summary": "  Recent observations estimate that 30% of early B and O-type stars are found\nin triple systems. So far, the evolution of triple star systems has mainly been\nmodeled using fast stellar codes. Their accuracy decreases with increasing\nmass, limiting their reliability for predicting the evolutionary pathways of\nmassive triple systems. We coupled Tres, which by default uses Seba (fast\nstellar code) to Mesa to perform the first simulations of triple systems that\ncombine a triple secular evolutionary code with a detailed, on-the-fly stellar\ncode. After examining the differences between the stellar evolution predicted\nby the two codes, we simulate the evolution of a set of triple systems and\ncompare their predicted evolutionary pathways. The predicted stellar tracks\nbecome increasingly divergent with increasing mass and wind mass loss\nefficiency. The maximal radial extent, crucial for determining whether the\ncomponents of the triple systems interact, differ by up to two orders of\nmagnitude between the two stellar codes in the considered mass range. This\nleads to divergences in the triples evolutionary pathways predicted by mesa and\nseba. Using mesa instead of seba, the minimum period for avoiding inner mass\ntransfer is reduced by three orders of magnitude. This has important\nconsequences for the formation of GW sources through the triple compact object\nchannel. Our simulations offer new insights into the physics of triple systems,\nas key processes (mass loss, radial expansion, precession) are treated\nself-consistently. They indicate that the results of triple systems population\nsynthesis studies must be interpreted cautiously, in particular when the\nconsidered masses are outside the range of the grid the fast codes are based on\nand when significant stellar winds are considered.\n",

    "title": "Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces\n  Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884",
    "summary": "  We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for\nmapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous\nmethods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves--which contain limited\ninformation about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits\nas probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it\ncreates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot\nproperties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar\nvariability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map\nrepresentation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of\nStarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for\nspot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data\nexperiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar\norientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle\nevolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method\nto TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot\nconcentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based\napproach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing\nconstraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of\nrotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet\ncharacterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from\nplanetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic\nactivity patterns.

    "title": "Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and\n  viscosity",
    "summary": "  Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in\nfuture and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events\nGW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their\ncreation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of\ndark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the\ncriterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny\nendoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host.\nThe EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the\nhost or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and\npoorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and\nviscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and\nmagnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the\neffects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion\ncould be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled\naccretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of\nwhich depends on the mass and spin of the host.\n",

    "title": "Parameter Inference of Black Hole Images using Deep Learning in\n  Visibility Space",
    "summary": "  Using very long baseline interferometry, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)\ncollaboration has resolved the shadows of two supermassive black holes. Model\ncomparison is traditionally performed in image space, where imaging algorithms\nintroduce uncertainties in the recovered structure. Here, we develop a deep\nlearning framework to perform parameter inference in visibility space, directly\nusing the data measured by the interferometer without introducing potential\nerrors and biases from image reconstruction. First, we train and validate our\nframework on synthetic data derived from general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations that vary in magnetic field state,\nspin, and $R_\\mathrm{high}$. Applying these models to the real data obtained\nduring the 2017 EHT campaign, and only considering total intensity, we do not\nderive meaningful constraints on either of these parameters. At present, our\nmethod is limited both by theoretical uncertainties in the GRMHD simulations\nand variation between snapshots of the same underlying physical model. However,\nwe demonstrate that spin and $R_\\mathrm{high}$ could be recovered using this\nframework through continuous monitoring of our sources, which mitigates\nvariations due to turbulence. In future work, we anticipate that including\nspectral or polarimetric information will greatly improve the performance of\nthis framework.\n",

    "summary": "  Aims. The metal-poor star BPM 3066 belongs to the retrograde halo and\npresents unexpectedly strong spectral features of lithium. To gain insight into\nthe origin of this peculiar abundance, we investigate the chemistry and\nkinematic properties of this star. Methods. We performed a local thermodynamic\nequilibrium chemical abundance analysis of UVES/VLT high-resolution spectra of\nBPM 3066 using ATLAS9 and ATLAS12 model atmospheres and the MyGIsFOS code. We\nfurther characterised the orbital properties of the star by integrating its\norbit and analysing its integrals of motion using the galpy code. Results. The\nstar BPM 3066 shows an exceptional overabundance of both lithium and beryllium.\nThe abundances are A(Li) = 3.0 and A(Be) = 2.1, which are respectively about\n0.8 and 2.2 dex higher than the Li and Be abundances expected at [Fe/H] = -1.5,\nthe metallicity of the star. The observed ratio 7Li/9Be is 7.9, which is close\nto that expected from a synthesis by spallation processes. Overabundances of\nSi, Al, and of the neutron capture elements Sr,Y, Zr, and Ba are also measured.\nKinematically, BPM 3066 has an eccentric, strongly retrograde orbit, confined\nto a height lower than 1 kpc from the galactic plane, and it is a candidate\nmember of the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy. Conclusions. The processes\nleading to the 7Li and 9Be synthesis could have occurred in the environment of\na hypernova. This is supported by some abundance anomalies like the high value\nof Si, [Si/Fe]=1.2 and [Si/O]=1.1. However, the simultaneous high values of N,\nNa, Al, Sc, Ti, and Cu are at odds with the expectations from a hypernova.\nAlternatively, the abundances of BPM 3066 could result from the engulfing of\nrocky planets that were rich in spallated Li and Be. In both cases, it is\nremarkable that such an extreme abundance pattern has been found in a star\nbelonging to the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy.\n",

    "title": "On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in\n  neutron star merger simulations",
    "summary": "  The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about\nnuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help\nus elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about\nthe properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of\nneutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions\nfor these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of\nneutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\\nu$ for the\nnumber of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing\nneutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\\nu)$. Recent simulations\nfocused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve\nneutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\\nu$ over momentum space, preventing\ndirect calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an\nattractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos.\nTheir current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\\nu$: in our\nmost recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst\ncases, estimates of $f_\\nu$ to jump from $f_\\nu=0$ to $f_\\nu\\sim 10^5$. While\nthis is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos\nhas been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid\ndirect calculations of $f_\\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at\nwhich this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively\nsimple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\\nu$\ncan in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a\ncombination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and\nsmoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the\nmerger simulation uses.\n",

    "summary": "  Under $\\Lambda$CDM, recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance\nmeasures from DESI, which favor a low matter density $\\Omega_m$, are in\nmoderate $2-3\\sigma$ tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nobservations. This tension appears alternately as a preference for the sum of\nneutrino masses dropping below the $\\sum m_\\nu = 0.06$eV value required by\nneutrino oscillation measurements to formally negative values; a discrepant\nvalue of $\\Omega_m$ at 0.06eV; or preference for dynamical dark energy beyond\n$\\Lambda$CDM. We show that this tension largely arises from the CMB lensing\nconstraints on the calibration of the sound horizon for geometric measurements\nand relies on the measurement of the reionization optical depth $\\tau$ from\nlarge-angle CMB polarization to set the lensing amplitude. Dropping these\nconstraints removes the neutrino tension at $\\sum m_\\nu=0.06$eV entirely,\nfavoring $\\tau = 0.091\\pm 0.011$ in $\\Lambda$CDM. Beyond $\\Lambda$CDM, it\nbrings the preference for $w_0-w_a$ dynamical dark energy to below $95\\%$ CL.\nWe explore the freedom in interpreting the low-$\\ell$ EE polarization\nconstraint due to analysis choices and reionization modeling beyond the\nstandard step-function assumption and find that this drops the neutrino tension\nin $\\Lambda$CDM to below $95\\%$ CL. Alternately, this raising of $\\tau$ can\nalso be achieved by the same reduction in large-scale curvature fluctuations\nthat also ameliorates the low-$\\ell$ temperature anomaly.\n",

    "title": "The Challenges of Detecting Gases in Exoplanet Atmospheres",
    "summary": "  Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on\ncomparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species.\nHowever, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction\nis vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is\ntypically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of\ntrace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust\nidentification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low\nsignal-to-noise regime. We illustrate these challenges using the sub-Neptune\nK2-18~b, where recent claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish when\nthe considered model space is expanded. We show that numerous alternative\nmodels without potential biosignature gases provide equivalent or better fits\nto the observations. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed\ndetection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model\npreference does not necessarily imply the presence of any specific gas.\n",

    "title": "Biases from Missing a Small Planet in High Multiplicity Systems",
    "summary": "  In an era when we are charting multiple planets per system, one might wonder\nthe extent to which \"missing\" (or failing to detect) a planet can skew our\ninterpretation of the system architecture. We address this question with a\nsimple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove\nplanets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture\nchange. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then\nrepeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying\nhyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as\nfaithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the\nfailure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced\nplanets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially\nunaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is\nthat the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the\nobservation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection\nbias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the\nobserved planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of\nthe Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the\ninterpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular\nspacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary\narchitectures that reproduces these observed patterns.\n",

    "summary": "  In numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova and binary neutron stars\nmergers information about the energetics and composition of matter is\nimplemented via external tables covering the huge ranges of thermodynamic\nconditions explored during the astrophysical evolution. More than 120 general\npurpose equation of state tables have been contributed so far. Not all of them\ncomply with current constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear\nphysics and astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Systematic\ninvestigations of the role that dense matter properties play in the evolution\nof these astrophysical phenomena require that more equation of state tables are\nprovided. We build a set of general purpose equation of state tables. At zero\ntemperature, they comply with all currently accepted constraints, including ab\ninitio chiral effective field theory calculations of pure neutron and symmetric\nnuclear matter. This set is designed to explore a wide variety of the behaviors\nof the effective masses as functions of density, which is reflected into a wide\nrange of thermal behaviors. We employ Brussels extended Skyrme interactions\ngenerated by means of Bayesian inference techniques. An extended nuclear\nstatistical equilibrium model is developed for modeling sub-saturated\ninhomogeneous nuclear matter. We study the properties of sub-saturated\ninhomogeneous nuclear matter over wide ranges of density, temperature and\nproton fraction. We analyze the mechanisms of transition to homogeneous matter\nand estimate the transition density. Our key results include the presence of a\nthink $^{14}$He layer in the inner crusts of (neo-)neutron stars, significant\nabundance of other exotic isotopes of H and He in warm and neutron rich matter\nand a detailed study of the thermodynamic stability of cold stellar matter.

Here the treatment of optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nis improved and the counts are extended to 5.6 mu and optical wavelengths.

    "title": "The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: First\n  Detection of Mid-Infrared Lags in Prototypical IMBHs in NGC 4395 and POX 52",
    "summary": "  The search for robust evidence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is\ncrucial for understanding black hole seeding process and the formation of\nsupermassive black holes in the early Universe. NGC 4395 and POX 52 are two\nprototypical IMBH hosts, both exhibiting multi-line evidence of low-mass black\nhole activity. Here, we report the first detection of mid-infrared (MIR) lags\nin response to optical variability, with measurements of $3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9}$\ndays for NGC 4395 and $35.2^{+14.2}_{-11.7}$ days for POX~52 at $3.4$ $\\mu$m,\nrespectively, using archival optical data and observations from the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This detection provides the first\nreverberation evidence of low-mass black hole activity in POX 52. The time lags\nof these two low-mass, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) generally\nfollow the extent of the $R_{\\rm dust}-L_{\\rm 5100}$ relation found in\nhigher-mass AGNs. Based on an empirical relation between the broad-line region\nand dusty torus size, we constrain the black hole mass of POX 52 to log($M_{\\rm\nBH}$/$M_\\odot$) = 5.5 $\\pm$ 0.37 (systemic and statistical errors), confirming\nits IMBH nature. Furthermore, long-term optical continuum monitoring of POX 52\nreveals a mild inter-band lag of $\\lesssim$ 1 day. However, no significant\nintranight variability was detected during its one-night, high-cadence\nmonitoring, which we attribute to the longer duty cycle of fast variability in\nPOX 52 compared to that in NGC 4395.\n",

    "summary": "  We present the results from our multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the\ntransient AT2022wtn, discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus\nof SDSSJ232323.79+104107.7, the less massive galaxy in an active merging pair\nwith a mass ratio of ~10:1. AT2022wtn shows spectroscopic and photometric\nproperties consistent with a X-ray faint N-strong TDE-H+He with a number of\npeculiarities. Specifically, a 30-days long plateau at maximum luminosity, a\ncorresponding dip in temperature and the development of a double-horned N III+\nHe II line profile. Strong and time-evolving velocity offsets in the TDE broad\nemission lines and the detection of a transient radio emission, indicate the\npresence of outflows. Overall, the observed properties are consistent with the\nfull disruption of a low-mass star by a ~10$^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$ SMBH followed by\nan efficient disk formation and the launch of a quasi-spherical reprocessing\nenvelope of fast expanding outflowing material. The observed differences\nbetween the He II and the Hydrogen and N III lines can be explained either with\na spatial separation of the lines emitting region or with a late-time reveal of\nshocks from the returning debris streams, as the photosphere recedes. Finally,\nwe present an extensive analysis of the hosting environment and discuss the\nimplications for the discovery of two TDEs in interacting galaxy pairs, finding\nindication for an over-representation of TDEs in these systems. The AT2022wtn\nhost galaxy properties suggest that it is in the early stages of the merger,\ntherefore we may be witnessing the initial enhanced rate of TDEs in interacting\ngalaxies before the post-starburst phase.\n",

Our timing analysis\nrevealed a pulsation period of approximately 7.02 s in the X-ray light curve.\nThe pulse profile obtained in the broad energy range is double-peaked and\nasymmetric in nature and shows moderate variation with the energy. An absorbed\npower-law model describes the 0.5-8 keV NICER spectra well. The 3-50 keV NuSTAR\nspectrum is best described with an absorbed power-law modified with a\nhigh-energy cutoff model. We find no evidence of iron or cyclotron line\nfeatures in the energy spectrum. During our observation period, the 0.5-50 keV\nluminosity varies in the range of $\\sim 8\\times10^{36} - 4\\times10^{37}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. We also discuss the dependence of spectral parameters on the\nrotational phase of the pulsar through phase-resolved spectroscopy.\n",

    "title": "Compact stellar systems hosting an intermediate mass black hole:\n  magnetohydrodynamic study of inflow-outflow dynamics",
    "summary": "  Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole\ndemographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar\nclusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts,\nwhere accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.\nYet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We\ninvestigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and\nmetallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole\naccretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and\nmagnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical\nabundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to\nexplore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the\naccretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude\nrelative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows\ndriven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas.\nWhile enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense\nclumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The\nsystem's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds,\nmasking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived,\nquasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these\nflares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our\nresults naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters\nand provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared\nobservational strategies.\n",

    "summary": "  During the 2022 outburst of SGR 1935+2154, a Fast-Radio-Burst-like event (FRB\n20221014A) and X-ray activities occurred between two spin-up glitches,\nsuggesting these glitches may connect to multiwavelength phenomenology.\nHowever, the mechanisms altering the magnetar's magnetosphere to enable radio\nemission remain unclear. This study presents high-cadence NICER and NuSTAR\nobservations revealing spectral changes in burst and persistent emission.\nHardness ratio and spectral analysis reveal significant changes during an\n\"intermediate flare\" 2.5 hours before FRB 20221014A. This 80-second flare,\nreleasing $>(6.3\\pm0.2)\\times10^{40}$ erg, coincides with a rapid spectral\nsoftening in both burst and persistent emission and a notable decrease in burst\noccurrence rate. The intermediate flare is bright enough to be detected if\nplaced at a few Mpc, and would appear as a fast X-ray transient. This implies\nthat the connection between magnetar X-ray activity and FRBs can be observed in\nthe local Universe. Post-flare burst spectra peak near 5 keV, resembling the\ncharacteristics of the FRB-associated X-ray burst of 2020. Such change\npersisted for a few hours, implying magnetospheric evolution on similar\ntimescales. However, no radio emission was detected from post-flare bursts,\nsuggesting that FRB emission requires conditions beyond peculiar short bursts.\nThe burst waiting times exhibit a broken power-law distribution, likely\nresulting from contamination by enhanced persistent emission. Although the\nbursts appear randomly distributed in the spin phase, the hardness ratio\nprofile as a function of spin phase follows that of the persistent emission,\nindicating that X-ray bursts originate at low altitudes.\n",

    "title": "No Evidence of Anomalous Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals",
    "summary": "  Diffusion in Yukawa crystals is stochastic due to the thermally activated\nformation of vacancy-interstitial pairs, which have poor statistics in\nsimulations. This makes it difficult to argue if Yukawa crystals exhibit normal\ndiffusion, or if they could be subdiffusive or superdiffusive. To resolve this,\nwe run a long molecular dynamics simulation of an idealized Yukawa crystal for\na billion timesteps. We find no evidence of anomalous diffusion in the pure\ncrystal, but also caution readers against overinterpreting this result as real\ncrystals have complicated structures including grains and defects.\n",
